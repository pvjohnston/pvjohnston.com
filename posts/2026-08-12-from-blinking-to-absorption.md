description: A single fluorescent molecule blinks; a cuvette full of the same molecules gives a smooth absorption band. The two pictures are the same Jablonski diagram read at different scales — one molecule versus an ensemble, one photon at a time versus a steady-state rate. This post traces the path from quantized absorption and emission events to a bulk spectrum, and extends the same diagram to two-photon absorption as the nonlinear version of the same transition.
post-type: understanding
question: How does the same electronic transition produce blinking photons under a microscope and a smooth absorption spectrum in a cuvette, and where does the nonlinear signal come from?

## 1. Two pictures of the same molecule

A confocal microscope focused on a dilute dye film records a trace of light that
comes in bursts: bright intervals separated by dark gaps, never two photons at
the same instant, with occasional long blackouts when the molecule shelves into
a triplet state. The same dye dissolved at micromolar concentration in a cuvette
gives a smooth UV–visible band on a spectrometer, a continuous curve peaked at
some wavelength and broadened over tens of nanometers. The two experiments are
looking at the same electronic transition, but the first sees *events* and the
second sees a *rate*.

The question this note answers is how one picture becomes the other. The route
runs through a single object — the molecular Jablonski diagram — read at
different scales. One molecule absorbs and emits one photon at a time, so its
spectrum is a sequence of discrete events governed by the radiative lifetime. A
bulk sample contains enough molecules that the individual events blur into a
steady current, and the envelope of that current is the absorption band. The
same diagram, taken to higher order in the light–matter interaction, also
describes two-photon absorption: the nonlinear signal is the same transition
accessed with two photons instead of one.

## 2. One molecule: absorption and emission as discrete events

Start with one molecule and two electronic states: a ground state
$|g\rangle$ and an excited state $|e\rangle$ separated by $E_{eg} =
\hbar\omega_{eg}$. In a weak light field the molecule behaves like a two-level
system. Absorption promotes it from $|g\rangle$ to $|e\rangle$ at a rate
$k_{\text{abs}} = \sigma \Phi$, where $\sigma$ is the absorption cross section
and $\Phi$ is the photon flux. Once in $|e\rangle$ it waits for a time of order
$1/k_{\text{rad}}$ and then emits one photon, dropping back to $|g\rangle$
(Figure 1).

The spontaneous emission rate is not an independent parameter: it is fixed by
the same transition dipole moment $|\boldsymbol{\mu}_{eg}|$ that sets the
absorption cross section. That connection is the Einstein $A$ coefficient, and
it is why a strong absorber is also a fast emitter.[@Einstein1917; @Hilborn1982]
For the single molecule, though, the important point is that the cycle is
quantized: it absorbs one photon, then emits one photon, then waits to absorb
another. Within the two-level model there is no state above $|e\rangle$ to
absorb into, so the molecule cannot take up a second photon of the same energy
while it is excited. A real dye does have higher electronic states and can show
excited-state absorption, but at the weak intensities considered here that
channel is negligible, and the emission stream stays intermittent at the
single-photon level.

**Figure 1.** One molecule's Jablonski diagram. Absorption promotes the molecule
from $|g\rangle$ to $|e\rangle$; spontaneous emission returns it. A triplet
state $|t\rangle$ acts as a dark shelf, producing the long dark intervals in a
single-molecule trace.

## 3. Why a single molecule blinks

The intermittency has two signatures. The first is antibunching: the probability
of detecting two photons at essentially the same instant drops to zero, because
the molecule must be re-excited before it can emit again — an effect measured
directly on a single dye molecule in a solid.[@Basche1992] The second is the
longer dark intervals produced by triplet shelving, spectral diffusion, or
photobleaching.[@MoernerOrrit1999] In those dark periods the molecule is no
longer in the $|g\rangle \leftrightarrow |e\rangle$ cycle at all; it has been
diverted to a non-emissive state or has changed its resonance out of the
excitation window.

Consequently the spectrum of a single molecule is not a continuous band. It is a
sequence of $\delta$-like emission events, each centred at the molecule's own
transition frequency, separated by waiting times drawn from the absorption and
emission rates. Only when enough of these events are collected does the histogram
of detected photons start to look like a line shape, and even then it is the line
shape of one molecule in one local environment.

## 4. From one molecule to many: ensemble averaging

Now put $N$ copies of the molecule in the beam, dilute enough that each
interacts with the light independently. The total absorption rate is simply $N$
times the single-molecule rate, and that proportionality is the content of the
Beer–Lambert law: the fraction of light absorbed in a thin slab is the number
of molecules in the slab times the single-molecule cross
section.[@Swinehart1962]

Two kinds of broadening separate the ensemble band from the single-molecule
line. The finite lifetime of $|e\rangle$ gives every molecule the same
**homogeneous** Lorentzian line shape of half-width $\gamma$,

$$L(\nu;\nu_i) = \frac{\gamma/\pi}{(\nu-\nu_i)^2 + \gamma^2},$$

centred at that molecule's own transition frequency $\nu_i$. But no two
molecules sit in identical surroundings — local strain, polarity, and packing
shift each $\nu_i$ slightly — so across the ensemble the centre frequencies are
scattered. Modelling that scatter as a Gaussian distribution of standard
deviation $\sigma$ and averaging the Lorentzians,

$$S_N(\nu) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} L(\nu;\nu_i),$$

turns the forest of narrow lines into a single smooth, **inhomogeneously
broadened** envelope as $N$ grows (Figure 2).[@LakowiczPrinciples2006]

</figure>

**Figure 2.** From one molecule to a bulk band. Top: a single two-level molecule
has a narrow Lorentzian line. Middle: four molecules in slightly different
environments give four shifted Lorentzians. Bottom: averaging over ensembles of
$N$ molecules recovers the smooth, inhomogeneously broadened band measured in a
cuvette; the dashed curve is the analytic Gaussian limit.

Code 1 is the demonstration behind Figure 2, condensed to its two moves: draw
each molecule's centre frequency from a Gaussian, then average the Lorentzians.
It uses only the Python standard library.

**Code 1.** The core of the ensemble-averaging demonstration: each molecule
contributes the same Lorentzian cross section shifted to its own centre
frequency, and the ensemble spectrum is the plain average.

```python
import math, random

def lorentzian(x, x0, gamma):
    return (gamma / math.pi) / ((x - x0) ** 2 + gamma ** 2)

gamma = 2.0              # homogeneous linewidth (HWHM), cm^-1
sigma = 40.0             # inhomogeneous Gaussian width, cm^-1
N = 10_000

random.seed(0)
centres = [random.gauss(0.0, sigma) for _ in range(N)]

nu = [-300 + 600 * i / 999 for i in range(1000)]
spectrum = [sum(lorentzian(x, c, gamma) for c in centres) / N for x in nu]
```

On the plotted grid the one-molecule line has a full width at half maximum of
[single_molecule_fwhm]{.metric} cm⁻¹, while the averaged band of the
$N = 10{,}000$ ensemble is [ensemble_fwhm]{.metric} cm⁻¹ wide — within
[fwhm_gaussian_deviation]{.metric} of the analytic Gaussian limit
$2\sqrt{2\ln 2}\,\sigma$ = [gaussian_limit_fwhm]{.metric} cm⁻¹. The sum is not
mysterious: each term is the same microscopic cross section, only shifted by
the local environment. A spectrometer does not resolve the individual terms; it
measures their average.

## 5. The bulk absorption spectrum is the same transition dipole

The integrated intensity of the bulk absorption band is proportional to
$|\boldsymbol{\mu}_{eg}|^2$, exactly the same quantity that sets the
single-molecule emission rate.[@StricklerBerg1962] The [molar absorptivity
post](/posts/2026-07-03-molar-absorptivity-is-a-rate-constant.html) traced this
in the other direction: measuring an absorption spectrum is a way of measuring a
lifetime, because both observables read the same transition dipole.

What changes in the bulk measurement is not the molecule but the bookkeeping. A
continuous absorption curve does not mean one molecule is absorbing
continuously; it means the ensemble is absorbing at a steady rate. The cross
section $\sigma(\nu)$ is still a per-molecule quantity. Beer–Lambert's law,
$A = \varepsilon(\nu)\,c\,\ell$, merely multiplies that per-molecule response
by the number of molecules in the beam. The smoothness comes from the large $N$
limit, not from any change in the microscopic physics.

## 6. The nonlinear extension: two-photon absorption from the same diagram

The same Jablonski diagram that governs one-photon absorption also governs
nonlinear absorption, read at second order in the field. In one-photon
absorption a single photon of energy $\hbar\omega_{eg}$ carries the molecule
from $|g\rangle$ to $|e\rangle$. In two-photon absorption the molecule reaches
the same state by taking up two photons whose energies *sum* to $E_{eg}$ — in
the degenerate case drawn in Figure 3, two photons of $\hbar\omega_{eg}/2$
each — passing through a virtual intermediate state that is not a stationary
state of the molecule.[@GoppertMayer1931]

\begin{tikzpicture}[>=Stealth,scale=1.0]
  % Energy levels
  \draw[thick] (0,0) -- (3,0) node[right] {$|g\rangle$};
  \draw[thick] (0,3) -- (3,3) node[right] {$|e\rangle$};
  % One-photon absorption
  \draw[->,red!70!black,line width=1.5pt] (0.8,0.1) -- (0.8,2.9);
  \node[red!60!black,right,font=\small] at (0.9,1.5) {$h\nu_{eg}$};
  % Two-photon absorption
  \draw[->,green!50!black,line width=1.2pt] (2,0.1) -- (2,1.45);
  \node[green!50!black,right,font=\small] at (2.1,0.75) {$h\nu_{eg}/2$};
  \draw[->,green!50!black,line width=1.2pt] (2,1.55) -- (2,2.9);
  \node[green!50!black,right,font=\small] at (2.1,2.25) {$h\nu_{eg}/2$};
  % Virtual state
  \draw[dashed,green!40!black] (1.5,1.5) -- (3.5,1.5);
  \node[green!40!black,right,font=\small] at (3.6,1.5) {virtual};
\end{tikzpicture}
```

**Figure 3.** The same two states read at first and second order. One-photon
absorption (red) reaches $|e\rangle$ with a single photon. Two-photon absorption
(green) reaches the same state with two photons of half the energy, passing
through a virtual intermediate level that is not a stationary state of the
molecule.

The selection rules of the two routes are complementary rather than shared. In
a centrosymmetric molecule, where every electronic state has a definite parity,
a one-photon transition connects states of *opposite* parity
($g \leftrightarrow u$), while a two-photon transition connects states of the
*same* parity ($g \leftrightarrow g$ or $u \leftrightarrow u$) — each photon
contributes one parity flip.[@McClain1974] The
[selection-rules post](/posts/2026-07-08-forbidden-and-allowed-symmetry-selection-rules.html)
works through where those rules come from; in a molecule without an inversion
centre neither rule is strict, and the same excited state can be reachable by
both routes with different strengths. The nonlinear signal is also weak: its
rate scales with the square of the intensity, which is why two-photon
absorption matters only under a focused laser. But it is the same molecule, the
same pair of states, and the same transition dipoles, read at higher order.

## 7. Reproducibility of the demonstrations

Figures 1 and 3 are TikZ energy-level diagrams compiled by the site build.
Figure 2 and the linewidths quoted in §4 are generated by
`research/from-blinking-to-absorption/src/ensemble_broadening.py` — Python
3.12.3, standard library only, seeded with `random.seed(0)` so every run is
bit-reproducible — of which Code 1 is a condensed excerpt. Running
`python3 research/from-blinking-to-absorption/src/ensemble_broadening.py` from
the repository root rewrites the figure and the canonical
`results/summary.json`, from which `generate-metrics.mjs` derives the values
cited in the text; the experiment directory records the environment and
publishes every file involved.

## 8. Where the model stops

Everything above assumes independent molecules. The single-molecule/bulk
connection breaks down when intermolecular interactions matter — excitonic
coupling, aggregation, concentrated dyes — because the ensemble spectrum then
stops being a sum of one-molecule spectra. The two-photon treatment is
perturbative: strong fields bring saturation and Rabi oscillations, which need
a different model, and the two-level approximation itself hides the higher
excited states responsible for excited-state absorption. Finally, the clean
split between one homogeneous linewidth and one inhomogeneous distribution is
an idealization: a single molecule's resonance can wander in time (spectral
diffusion), so which broadening counts as "the molecule's own" depends on the
timescale of the measurement.

## 9. Summary

The single-molecule trace and the bulk absorption band are not two different
phenomena; they are the same Jablonski diagram read at different scales. One
molecule emits photons one at a time, with waiting times set by the absorption
flux and the radiative lifetime. An ensemble of many molecules, each in a
slightly different environment, averages those discrete lines into the smooth
band a spectrometer records. The cross section that governs the single-molecule
absorption rate is the same cross section that appears in Beer–Lambert's law;
the only new ingredient in the bulk measurement is the number of molecules.

The nonlinear extension is the same diagram read at higher order. Two-photon
absorption reaches $|e\rangle$ with two photons that share the transition
energy, through a virtual state, and in centrosymmetric molecules its selection
rules are complementary to those of one-photon absorption. Underneath all three
versions — blinking, bulk absorption, and nonlinear absorption — is the same
transition dipole.
