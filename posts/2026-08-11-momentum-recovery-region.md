## Abstract

Villatoro, Geraci, and Schiavazzi's 2026 article, *Assessing the Performance
of Correlation-Based Multi-Fidelity Neural Emulators*, benchmarks SIREN
networks on multi-fidelity tasks and writes down one of the two circulating
SIREN parameterizations.[@Villatoro2026; @Sitzmann2020] This post is an
independent extension of that benchmark — the fourth in a series that
reimplements the written K1 specification in NumPy and probes how the two
parameterizations train — and it measures something the series left open: as
the heavy-ball momentum coefficient $\beta$ varies over
$\{0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 0.99\}$, how wide is the set of learning rates at which
the *described* convention reaches the *official* convention's error floor?

The answer is not a monotone widening. The stage-1 recovery counts are
[recovered_points_beta_0]{.metric}, [recovered_points_beta_03]{.metric},
[recovered_points_beta_06]{.metric}, [recovered_points_beta_09]{.metric}, and
[recovered_points_beta_099]{.metric} grid points in order of increasing
$\beta$: nothing below $\beta=0.9$, a knife-edge of
[refined_width_beta_09_decades]{.metric} decades at $\beta=0.9$ hard against
the divergence boundary, and a wide low-rate plateau of at least
[refined_width_beta_099_decades]{.metric} decades at
$\beta=0.99$ — while the divergence boundary, which had tracked the
heavy-ball $1+\beta$ prediction within a grid step through $\beta=0.9$,
collapses back to its plain-SGD value ([boundary_ratio_beta_099]{.metric}
relative to $\beta=0$) and an instability band with finite errors as large as
[described_worst_finite_beta_099]{.metric} opens below it. The registered
hypothesis — monotone widening, with recovery at every $\beta>0.5$ — is
**falsified**: $\beta=0.6$ recovers at no tested rate.

## Introduction

The two SIREN parameterizations represent the same function at initialization
and train differently. The described convention draws hidden weights from
$\mathcal{U}(\pm\sqrt{6/n})$ and applies $\sin(Wx+b)$; the official
implementation draws from $\mathcal{U}(\pm\sqrt{6/n}/\omega_0)$ and applies
$\sin(\omega_0(Wx+b))$.[@Sitzmann2020; @SirenOfficial] On the K1 task of
Villatoro et al., this series has measured the convention gap under
[Adam](/posts/2026-07-17-why-the-two-siren-conventions-train-differently.html),
under
[plain SGD](/posts/2026-07-18-the-sgd-control-900-on-the-hidden-stack.html),
and under
[heavy-ball momentum at $\beta=0.9$](/posts/2026-07-19-the-momentum-control.html).
That last note found the gap closed at exactly one tested learning rate —
the final stable point of a $0.05$-decade grid, one grid step below the
divergence boundary — with the boundary itself moved up by a factor
consistent with the quadratic heavy-ball bound $2(1+\beta)/L$, against $2/L$
for gradient descent.

One tested point is a measurement of a set's size only in the coarsest sense.
If the recovered-rate region scales with the gap between the heavy-ball and
gradient-descent stability bounds, it should close as $\beta\to0$ and widen
toward $1+\beta$ — the reading the momentum-control note's Conclusion queued
as its next experiment. Whether it does is what this note measures. A region
that widens smoothly with $\beta$ would make momentum a usable repair for the
described convention; a region that stays a single grid point, or vanishes at
intermediate $\beta$, would make the $\beta=0.9$ recovery a knife-edge.

**Hypothesis.** The recovery region widens monotonically (nondecreasing) with
$\beta\in\{0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 0.99\}$, riding the stability boundary upward,
and the described convention reaches the official error floor at at least one
tested rate for every $\beta>0.5$. **Falsifier, fixed before running:** the
width does not vary monotonically with $\beta$, or the described convention
reaches the floor at no tested rate for some $\beta>0.5$. Either outcome was
publishable: the first names a usable repair, the second a knife-edge, and
both are rules a practitioner can act on. The hypothesis, falsifier, grids,
recovery rule, and decision rule were frozen in a
[preregistration](/research/momentum-recovery-region/PREREGISTRATION.md)
before the canonical run, and are reported as registered.

## Computational Methods

All numbers were produced on CPython 3.13.12, arm64 macOS 26.5.2, NumPy
2.4.4, no other result dependency; the figure additionally used matplotlib
3.11.1. This was a computer-only numerical experiment using synthetic inputs
and deterministic code; it involved no living subjects and no human or animal
data. Model, task, data, seeds, and manual backprop are those of the
momentum-control note without change, vendored from its committed script into
[this experiment's sweep driver](/research/momentum-recovery-region/src/run_sweep.py)
with unused code paths removed: K1 from Villatoro et al., eq. (4), fit by
their multi-fidelity architecture with the exact low-fidelity function, the
nonlinear branch a SIREN of three hidden layers of sixteen units,
$\omega_0=30$, $c=6$, $N_H=32$ Sobol' samples plus the two boundary points,
errors reported as normalized test MSE.[@Villatoro2026] Both conventions in a
repetition start from one parameter draw, with the matched official
parameterization dividing hidden weights and biases by $\omega_0$ — the same
declared idealization as before; the official repository rescales weights
alone.[@Sitzmann2020; @SirenOfficial] The update is full-batch heavy-ball
momentum, $v \leftarrow \beta v + g$, $\theta \leftarrow \theta -
\text{lr}\cdot v$, for $20{,}000$ epochs; $\beta=0$ through the same code
path is the plain-SGD control. The vendored training path was checked against
the earlier script on this machine before the canonical run: identical
output, bit for bit, on the July recovery cell. The earlier notes ran on a
different machine (CPython 3.10.12, aarch64 Linux, NumPy 2.2.6); values that
sit at the float64 error floor move at roundoff scale across environments, so
floor values quoted here are this environment's, while the recovery events
and divergence boundaries reproduce the earlier notes' values exactly.

I used neither the source authors' program nor their data: their code remains
unreleased, K1 is a closed-form test case printed in the paper, and every
number describes my independent NumPy reimplementation of their written
specification.

The frozen protocol has two stages. Stage 1 runs both conventions at each
$\beta\in\{0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 0.99\}$ on a common $35$-point grid from
$10^{-4}$ to $10^{-2.3}$ at $0.05$-decade spacing, three repetitions (data
seeds $1544$–$1546$, parameter seeds $7000$–$7002$ as before) —
[stage1_training_count]{.metric} trainings. A grid point counts as
**recovered** when the median normalized test MSE over the three repetitions
is at most $10^{-24}$, a threshold frozen about three orders of magnitude
above the official convention's $\beta=0.9$ floor; a repetition that returns a
non-finite error makes its point not recovered rather than being excluded.
Stage 2 applies a frozen refinement rule: for each $\beta$ with at least one
recovered stage-1 point, a $0.01$-decade grid from $0.10$ decades below the
lowest recovered rate up to the lowest rate at which any repetition diverged,
[stage2_training_count]{.metric} further trainings. The decision rule:
supported if the stage-1 recovered counts are nondecreasing in $\beta$ and
every $\beta\in\{0.6, 0.9, 0.99\}$ recovers at at least one tested rate;
falsified otherwise; inconclusive had the counts been equal with the refined
widths unable to separate them. Recovery counts at the sensitivity thresholds
$10^{-20}$ and $10^{-28}$ are recorded alongside. Code 1 gives the exact
commands; the canonical outputs are
[stage1.json](/research/momentum-recovery-region/results/stage1.json) and
[stage2.json](/research/momentum-recovery-region/results/stage2.json), and
every result number in this post resolves from the committed
[metrics projection](/research/momentum-recovery-region/metrics.json) at
build time.

```bash
cd research/momentum-recovery-region
python3 src/run_sweep.py    # stage 1, then stage 2 by the frozen rule
node generate-metrics.mjs   # project results/*.json into metrics.json
```

**Code 1.** Exact commands for the canonical run and the metrics projection,
from the repository root and experiment directory respectively.

## Results

Table 1 summarizes stage 1. The described convention's recovered-point counts
across $\beta\in\{0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 0.99\}$ are
[recovered_points_beta_0]{.metric}, [recovered_points_beta_03]{.metric},
[recovered_points_beta_06]{.metric}, [recovered_points_beta_09]{.metric},
[recovered_points_beta_099]{.metric}; the counts are identical at the
$10^{-20}$ and $10^{-28}$ sensitivity thresholds. The best described median
test error is $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-6}$ at $\beta\le0.6$,
[described_best_beta_09]{.metric} at $\beta=0.9$, and
[described_best_beta_099]{.metric} at $\beta=0.99$. The official convention's
median test error over finite grid points decreases from
[official_median_beta_0]{.metric} at $\beta=0$ to
[official_median_beta_099]{.metric} at $\beta=0.99$.

**Table 1.** Stage-1 results per momentum coefficient: described-convention
recovered-point count at the frozen $10^{-24}$ threshold, best tested
learning rate and best median normalized test MSE, official-convention median
over finite points, first divergent learning rate, and the divergence
boundary relative to $\beta=0$ against the $1+\beta$ prediction.

| $\beta$ | recovered points | best tested lr | best described MSE | official median MSE | first divergent lr | boundary ratio | $1+\beta$ |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| $0$ | [recovered_points_beta_0]{.metric} | [described_best_lr_beta_0]{.metric} | [described_best_beta_0]{.metric} | [official_median_beta_0]{.metric} | [boundary_beta_0]{.metric} | [boundary_ratio_beta_0]{.metric} | $1$ |
| $0.3$ | [recovered_points_beta_03]{.metric} | [described_best_lr_beta_03]{.metric} | [described_best_beta_03]{.metric} | [official_median_beta_03]{.metric} | [boundary_beta_03]{.metric} | [boundary_ratio_beta_03]{.metric} | $1.3$ |
| $0.6$ | [recovered_points_beta_06]{.metric} | [described_best_lr_beta_06]{.metric} | [described_best_beta_06]{.metric} | [official_median_beta_06]{.metric} | [boundary_beta_06]{.metric} | [boundary_ratio_beta_06]{.metric} | $1.6$ |
| $0.9$ | [recovered_points_beta_09]{.metric} | [described_best_lr_beta_09]{.metric} | [described_best_beta_09]{.metric} | [official_median_beta_09]{.metric} | [boundary_beta_09]{.metric} | [boundary_ratio_beta_09]{.metric} | $1.9$ |
| $0.99$ | [recovered_points_beta_099]{.metric} | [described_best_lr_beta_099]{.metric} | [described_best_beta_099]{.metric} | [official_median_beta_099]{.metric} | [boundary_beta_099]{.metric} | [boundary_ratio_beta_099]{.metric} | $1.99$ |

The first divergent learning rate is identical for the two conventions at
every $\beta$ (described [boundary_beta_09]{.metric} and official
[boundary_official_beta_09]{.metric} at $\beta=0.9$, and likewise elsewhere).
The boundary ratios to $\beta=0$ are [boundary_ratio_beta_03]{.metric},
[boundary_ratio_beta_06]{.metric}, [boundary_ratio_beta_09]{.metric} at
$\beta=0.3, 0.6, 0.9$ — within one $0.05$-decade grid step ($1.122$) of the
$1+\beta$ values $1.3$, $1.6$, $1.9$ — and [boundary_ratio_beta_099]{.metric}
at $\beta=0.99$, against a prediction of $1.99$. The $\beta=0$ boundary,
[boundary_beta_0]{.metric}, matches the plain-SGD value reported in the SGD
note.

Table 2 summarizes stage 2. At $\beta=0.9$ the recovered set is
[refined_recovered_points_beta_09]{.metric} adjacent refined grid points —
[refined_width_beta_09_decades]{.metric} decades — ending at the stage-1
boundary rate [recovered_top_lr_beta_09]{.metric}; the refined grid's first
divergence is [refined_boundary_beta_09]{.metric}. At $\beta=0.99$ the
recovered set is [refined_recovered_points_beta_099]{.metric} refined grid
points — [refined_width_beta_099_decades]{.metric} decades — running from the
bottom of its refinement window up to [recovered_top_lr_beta_099]{.metric};
the region reaches the window's bottom edge, so the width is a lower bound.

**Table 2.** Stage-2 refinement at $0.01$-decade resolution for the two
momentum coefficients with a stage-1 recovery: recovered-point count, width,
best described median test error, first divergent rate on the refined grid,
and whether the recovered region reaches the bottom of its refinement window.

| $\beta$ | refined recovered points | refined width (decades) | refined best MSE | refined first divergent lr | censored below |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| $0.9$ | [refined_recovered_points_beta_09]{.metric} | [refined_width_beta_09_decades]{.metric} | [refined_described_best_beta_09]{.metric} | [refined_boundary_beta_09]{.metric} | [refined_width_censored_beta_09]{.metric} |
| $0.99$ | [refined_recovered_points_beta_099]{.metric} | [refined_width_beta_099_decades]{.metric} | [refined_described_best_beta_099]{.metric} | [refined_boundary_beta_099]{.metric} | [refined_width_censored_beta_099]{.metric} |

Between the $\beta=0.99$ plateau's upper edge and its divergence boundary,
the described convention's finite test errors reach
[described_worst_finite_beta_099]{.metric} and the official convention's
reach [official_worst_finite_beta_099]{.metric}; below $\beta=0.99$, no
finite described error on either grid exceeds
[described_worst_finite_beta_03]{.metric}.
Figure 1 shows the stage-1 error curves, the refined widths, and the boundary
ratios.

## Discussion

**Overall verdict: falsified, as registered.** The registered hypothesis had
two clauses, and the second fired the falsifier: at $\beta=0.6$ the described
convention reaches the floor at no tested rate, its best median error
[described_best_beta_06]{.metric} against the official convention's best
[official_best_beta_06]{.metric} at the same $\beta$. The first clause
survived only in the letter — the count sequence
[recovered_points_beta_0]{.metric}, [recovered_points_beta_03]{.metric},
[recovered_points_beta_06]{.metric}, [recovered_points_beta_09]{.metric},
[recovered_points_beta_099]{.metric} is nondecreasing — but a sequence that
is zero, zero, zero before anything happens is not the monotone widening the
hypothesis described, and the frozen decision rule says so.

What the curve actually does is more useful than what was predicted. Momentum's
rescue of the described convention is **bimodal**. At $\beta=0.9$ it is the
knife-edge the July note suspected: a single stage-1 point,
[refined_width_beta_09_decades]{.metric} decades wide at refinement, pressed
against the divergence boundary — a grid search at $0.05$-decade resolution
finds it by luck. At $\beta=0.99$ the rescue is real and wide, at least
[refined_width_beta_099_decades]{.metric} decades and uniform across
repetitions, but it sits at the *bottom* of the rate range rather than riding
the boundary, and the boundary itself no longer follows the heavy-ball rule:
after tracking $1+\beta$ within a grid step through $\beta=0.9$, it falls
back to the plain-SGD value, and the region between the plateau and the
boundary is a band of explosive but finite errors reaching
[described_worst_finite_beta_099]{.metric}. A practitioner running a
learning-rate search near $\beta=1$ on this parameterization will see
astronomically large finite losses that are not overflow, and a floor that is
reachable at small rates — a different hazard map than the one the $1+\beta$
rule draws, not an absence of one. If this bimodal structure is already
characterized somewhere in the heavy-ball literature, that reference is
exactly what we would like to be sent.

On mechanism we can offer a reading, not a measurement. The quadratic
heavy-ball bound $2(1+\beta)/L$ assumes a fixed curvature and a quadratic
mode; the boundary's collapse between $\beta=0.9$ and $\beta=0.99$ says at
least one of those premises fails there — either the relevant curvature moves
with $\beta$, or the mode that diverges first at $\beta=0.99$ is not the mode
the bound describes. The velocity amplification $1/(1-\beta)=100$ at
$\beta=0.99$ is the natural candidate for why the *low*-rate region trains at
all: a hundred-fold amplification of persistent gradients is large enough to
move the $\omega_0^2$-handicapped hidden stack at rates where plain SGD
cannot. Both readings are testable and neither is tested here; the Conclusion
queues the test.

**Limits.** One task, whose exactly linear cross-correlation lets the affine
branch carry the fit; one architecture; three repetitions; full-batch
heavy-ball without a Nesterov arm; a $10^{-24}$ threshold whose sensitivity
checks at $10^{-20}$ and $10^{-28}$ change nothing here but might elsewhere;
a $\beta=0.99$ plateau whose lower edge is unmeasured below $7.9\times10^{-5}$;
a different machine than the earlier notes, which moves roundoff-scale floor
values; and a reimplementation of an unreleased specification, which bounds
every claim to the written K1 setup.

## Conclusion

The recovery-region question now has its curve, and it is not the predicted
one: the set of rates at which momentum lets the described convention reach
the official floor is empty through $\beta=0.6$, a
[refined_width_beta_09_decades]{.metric}-decade knife-edge at $\beta=0.9$,
and a censored [refined_width_beta_099_decades]{.metric}-decade plateau at
$\beta=0.99$ whose divergence boundary has fallen back to the plain-SGD
value. Two experiments follow. First, the boundary collapse: track the top
curvature along the training trajectory at $\beta=0.9$ and $\beta=0.99$ and
test whether the quadratic heavy-ball bound fails there because $L$ moves or
because the first-diverging mode changes — the mechanism measurement this
note declined to assert. Second, the plateau's lower edge: extend the grid
below $7.9\times10^{-5}$ at $\beta=0.99$ until the described convention
leaves the floor, turning this note's lower bound into a width. Both go on
the shelf.
