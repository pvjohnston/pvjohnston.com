description: Dissolve cobalt chloride in water and the solution is pale pink; add hydrochloric acid and it turns an intense blue — same ion, same kind of transition, a hundredfold jump in intensity. The gap didn't change; the symmetry did. This post pays the pigment series' oldest promissory note and explains what "forbidden" and "allowed" actually mean — one integral, one parity argument, one character table — and why forbidden bands show up anyway.

Dissolve cobalt(II) chloride in water and you get a solution so pale it barely
counts as pink. Add concentrated hydrochloric acid and it flips to a saturated
royal blue. The ion is the same Co²⁺ throughout, the transitions are the same
family of $d$–$d$ excitations, and the color change from pink toward blue is the
familiar story of a shifting energy gap. But the *intensity* change is not: the
octahedral $[\mathrm{Co(H_2O)_6}]^{2+}$ absorbs with a molar absorptivity of
order 1–10 M⁻¹cm⁻¹, while tetrahedral $[\mathrm{CoCl_4}]^{2-}$ comes in around a
hundred times stronger [@atkins2010physical]. Nothing about the energy gap
explains a factor of a hundred. What changed is that the water complex has a
center of symmetry and the chloride complex does not.

The [pigments post](/posts/2026-07-04-the-physics-and-chemistry-of-pigments.html)
in this series leaned on exactly this fact — its Figure 3 drew site symmetry as
a dial running from *forbidden* (pale octahedral viridian) through *partly
allowed* (tetrahedral cobalt blue) to *fully allowed* (the trigonal-bipyramidal
site of YInMn blue) — and then left a promissory note: *what "symmetry,"
"forbidden," and "allowed" mean is the subject of a later post.* This is that
post. The claim to be earned is that hue and strength are set by two independent
dials — the gap sets the color, the symmetry sets the intensity — and the
machinery that earns it is one integral, one parity argument, and one small
table (Figure 1).

</figure>

**Figure 1.** Symmetry as a gate. Two molecules with the same energy gap face
the same light wave; the centrosymmetric one absorbs it feebly, the asymmetric
one strongly. The gap decides *which* photon fits; the symmetry decides *how
hard* the molecule can grab it.

## The integral that decides

Everything reduces to one quantity this series has already met. The
[matrix-element post](/posts/2026-07-03-one-matrix-element-absorptivity-and-the-pockels-effect.html)
traced molar absorptivity, refractive index, and the Pockels effect back to the
**transition dipole moment**,

$$
\boldsymbol{\mu}_{fi} \;=\; \langle \psi_f \,|\, \hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}} \,|\, \psi_i \rangle
\;=\; \int \psi_f^{*}\, \hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}\; \psi_i \, d\tau ,
$$

and the [absorptivity post](/posts/2026-07-03-molar-absorptivity-is-a-rate-constant.html)
packaged its square into the dimensionless **oscillator strength** $f$ — of
order 1 for the strongest transitions, and proportional to the band area you
actually measure. The intensity of any absorption band is, up to constants,
$|\boldsymbol{\mu}_{fi}|^2$.

A **selection rule** is nothing more mysterious than a statement about when
that integral is *exactly zero for reasons of symmetry alone* — before you know
anything about the detailed shapes of $\psi_i$ and $\psi_f$, their energies, or
the strength of the light. If symmetry forces $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{fi} = 0$, the
transition is **forbidden**: the state exists, the photon energy can match the
gap perfectly, and still — to first order — nothing happens. If symmetry
permits $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{fi} \neq 0$, the transition is **allowed**, which is
a license, not a guarantee: how large the integral actually is remains a
question about wavefunctions, the kind the
[push–pull post](/posts/2026-07-05-push-pull-chromophores-charge-transfer.html)
answered with TD-DFT. Symmetry only ever gives one of two answers — *exactly
zero* or *no comment* — and that binary verdict is worth several orders of
magnitude in a spectrum.

## An odd function integrates to zero

The entire argument, in its simplest form, is a fact from first-year calculus:
the integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval vanishes, because
every positive contribution on the right is cancelled by a mirror-image
negative contribution on the left (Figure 2). All the group theory below is
this one cancellation, generalized.

**Figure 2.** The whole machinery in one picture. Left: an odd integrand — every
positive patch of area has a mirror-image negative twin, and the total is
exactly zero no matter what the detailed shape is. Right: an even integrand —
the mirror halves add instead of cancelling. A selection rule is the statement
that symmetry makes the integrand of $\langle \psi_f | \hat{\mu} | \psi_i \rangle$
odd.

Now apply it to the transition dipole. In any molecule or crystal site that
possesses a **center of inversion** — a point through which every atom maps
onto an identical atom — every electronic state can be classified by **parity**:
*gerade* ($g$, even, unchanged by inversion) or *ungerade* ($u$, odd, sign-flipped).
The dipole operator $\hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}} = -e\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is built from
the coordinates themselves, and coordinates flip sign under inversion:
$\hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}$ is odd, always and everywhere. So the integrand of the
transition dipole between two $g$ states is $g \times u \times g = u$ — odd —
and the integral vanishes. Same for $u \rightarrow u$. Only $g \leftrightarrow u$
survives:

$$
g \rightarrow g \;\; \text{forbidden}, \qquad
u \rightarrow u \;\; \text{forbidden}, \qquad
g \leftrightarrow u \;\; \text{allowed}.
$$

That is the **Laporte rule**, and it is the entire explanation of the pale
octahedral pigments. The five $d$ orbitals are all even functions — $l = 2$,
parity $(-1)^l = +1$, *gerade* — so in a site with an inversion center every
$d$–$d$ transition is $g \rightarrow g$: forbidden. The chromium ions in
viridian sit in octahedra; octahedra have inversion centers; therefore viridian
is muted, however well its gap is tuned. The rule predates the machinery used
here to derive it — Otto Laporte and William Meggers extracted it empirically
from the term analysis of iron's atomic spectrum in 1925, a year before the
Schrödinger equation, as the observation that "even" terms combine only with
"odd" ones [@Laporte1925Rules]; Wigner later showed it is nothing but parity
conservation. The atomic version is the familiar $\Delta l = \pm 1$: $s
\rightarrow p$ allowed, $d \rightarrow d$ and $d \rightarrow s$ not.

Remove the inversion center and the argument evaporates — there is no parity
label left to conserve. A tetrahedral site has no inversion center, so in
$[\mathrm{CoCl_4}]^{2-}$ the $d$–$d$ bands are no longer parity-forbidden (the
metal $p$ orbitals, odd, can mix into the same symmetry species as the $d$'s
and lend them allowed character), and the hundredfold intensity jump of the
opening paragraph follows. The trigonal-bipyramidal site that makes
[YInMn blue](/posts/2026-07-04-the-physics-and-chemistry-of-pigments.html) so
intense is the same trick played deliberately: put Mn³⁺ where there is no
center of symmetry and the transition is free to be strong
[@SmithSubramanian2009]. The pigment post's dial from forbidden to allowed is,
literally, a dial of how thoroughly the site symmetry destroys the parity
cancellation of Figure 2.

## The character table: cancellation, bookkept

Parity handles molecules with an inversion center, but most molecules have
lower, less tidy symmetry — a rotation axis here, a mirror plane there — and
the cancellation argument still works; it just needs bookkeeping. That
bookkeeping is **group theory**, and the working object is the **character
table** [@Cotton1990Group; @Harris1989Symmetry].

The [water post](/posts/2026-06-30-reading-water-geometry-orbitals-acidity-spectra.html)
already used this machinery without naming it: it sorted water's orbitals into
"labelled boxes" — $a_1$, $b_1$, $b_2$ — under the point group $C_{2v}$. Those
labels are **irreducible representations** (irreps): the complete list of
distinct ways any function attached to the molecule can behave under its
symmetry operations. For $C_{2v}$ — one two-fold axis, two mirror planes — the
full table is small enough to show whole (Table 1), with the molecule in the
$yz$ plane as in the water post.

**Table 1.** The character table of $C_{2v}$, the point group of water and
formaldehyde. Each row is an irrep — a possible symmetry behavior — and each
entry says what a function of that species does under the operation at the top
of the column ($+1$ unchanged, $-1$ sign-flipped). The last column is the
payload for spectroscopy: which component of the dipole operator transforms as
which irrep. Note that no dipole component transforms as $A_2$.

| $C_{2v}$ | $E$ | $C_2$ | $\sigma_v(xz)$ | $\sigma_v'(yz)$ | linear function |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $A_1$ | $+1$ | $+1$ | $+1$ | $+1$ | $z$ |
| $A_2$ | $+1$ | $+1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ | — |
| $B_1$ | $+1$ | $-1$ | $+1$ | $-1$ | $x$ |
| $B_2$ | $+1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ | $+1$ | $y$ |

The generalization of "odd × odd = even" is that symmetry species multiply: the
integrand $\psi_f^* \,\hat{\mu}\, \psi_i$ belongs to the **product** of the
three species, $\Gamma_f \otimes \Gamma_\mu \otimes \Gamma_i$, computed by
multiplying the $\pm 1$'s column by column. And the generalization of "an odd
function integrates to zero" is:

> The integral $\langle \psi_f | \hat{\mu} | \psi_i \rangle$ can be nonzero
> only if $\Gamma_f \otimes \Gamma_\mu \otimes \Gamma_i$ contains the totally
> symmetric irrep (the top row, all $+1$'s).

Anything that is not totally symmetric changes sign under *some* operation of
the group — and then the same mirror-image cancellation of Figure 2 kills the
integral, with that operation playing the role of the inversion.

Two worked examples, both from molecules this blog has already computed. First
water: its HOMO is the out-of-plane lone pair $1b_1$, its LUMO the $4a_1$
antibonding orbital. The excitation $1b_1 \rightarrow 4a_1$ produces a $B_1$
excited state ($b_1 \otimes a_1 = b_1$), and the test asks whether
$B_1 \otimes \Gamma_\mu \otimes A_1$ can reach $A_1$. It can — pick the $x$
component, which is itself $B_1$, and $B_1 \otimes B_1 = A_1$. Allowed, and
allowed specifically for light polarized along $x$, perpendicular to the
molecular plane: the character table hands you the *polarization* of the band
as a free bonus, which is exactly the kind of information oriented-crystal and
poled-film spectroscopy trades on.

Second, formaldehyde — the same molecule whose excited states an
[early post on this blog](/posts/Comparative-Analysis-of-TD-DFT-Functionals-for-Formaldehyde-Excited-States.html)
computed with four density functionals. The famous low-energy band is the
$n \rightarrow \pi^*$ excitation: the in-plane oxygen lone pair ($b_2$) into
the out-of-plane $\pi^*$ ($b_1$), giving an excited state of species
$b_2 \otimes b_1 = A_2$. Now look back at Table 1: **no component of the
dipole operator transforms as $A_2$.** There is no polarization of light —
none — for which $A_2 \otimes \Gamma_\mu \otimes A_1$ contains $A_1$. The
transition is symmetry-forbidden, full stop. That TD-DFT study found the
$n \rightarrow \pi^*$ transition near 4 eV with "negligible oscillator
strength" in every functional — the computer rediscovering, numerically, a zero
that group theory hands you on one line. The experimental band obliges: it
shows up around 300 nm with a molar absorptivity of order ten, four orders of
magnitude below a fully allowed transition [@atkins2010physical].

One more subtlety the parity argument alone would miss: a molecule can lack an
inversion center and *still* forbid transitions, because any symmetry operation
can drive the cancellation. Benzene has an inversion center *and* a six-fold
axis and mirrors ($D_{6h}$), and its three famous ultraviolet bands are a
ladder of exactly this effect — all three are $g \rightarrow u$,
parity-allowed, yet two of them are killed by the ring's other symmetry
elements. The transitions to $^1B_{2u}$ (254 nm) and $^1B_{1u}$ (204 nm) are
orbitally forbidden in the full group; only $^1E_{1u}$ (~180 nm) is allowed
[@Harris1989Symmetry; @MullikenRieke1941].

## The intensity ladder

Put numbers on the verdicts and the spectrum organizes itself into a ladder
spanning six or seven orders of magnitude (Figure 3) — which is why "allowed
or forbidden?" is usually the first question worth asking about any band, ahead
of anything quantitative.

**Figure 3.** The intensity ladder: where symmetry verdicts land on a
logarithmic absorptivity axis. **A** — benzene's $^1E_{1u}$ band near 180 nm,
fully allowed, $\varepsilon \sim 6 \times 10^4$; **B** — benzene's $^1B_{1u}$
band at 204 nm, orbitally forbidden but strongly vibronically assisted,
$\varepsilon \approx 8{,}000$; **C** — benzene's $^1B_{2u}$ band at 254 nm,
orbitally forbidden, $\varepsilon \approx 240$; **D** — tetrahedral
$[\mathrm{CoCl_4}]^{2-}$, $d$–$d$ with no inversion center to forbid it,
$\varepsilon \sim 10^2$; **E** — octahedral $[\mathrm{Co(H_2O)_6}]^{2+}$,
Laporte-forbidden $d$–$d$, $\varepsilon \sim 5$; **F** — octahedral
$[\mathrm{Mn(H_2O)_6}]^{2+}$, forbidden by parity *and* spin at once,
$\varepsilon \lesssim 10^{-1}$. Each rung down the ladder is another selection
rule engaged; top to bottom spans roughly six orders of magnitude
[@atkins2010physical; @Harris1989Symmetry].

The ladder's bottom rung introduces the one selection rule this post has not
yet named, because it is not spatial at all. The dipole operator does nothing
to spin, so the spin state must be the same before and after:
$\Delta S = 0$, the **spin selection rule**. High-spin Mn²⁺ is a $d^5$ ion with
all five spins parallel, and *every* $d$–$d$ excitation must flip one — so
every visible transition of $[\mathrm{Mn(H_2O)_6}]^{2+}$ is spin-forbidden
*and* Laporte-forbidden simultaneously, and manganese(II) solutions are nearly
colorless, a hundred times paler than the merely Laporte-forbidden pink of
cobalt hexahydrate. The same rule, run in emission, is why phosphorescence —
emission from a triplet state back to a singlet ground state — is slow enough
to watch glow-in-the-dark stars fade for minutes: the transition is
spin-forbidden, its rate suppressed by orders of magnitude
[@LakowiczPrinciples2006].

## Why forbidden bands appear anyway

Every forbidden band in Figure 3 has a nonzero $\varepsilon$ — you can see
viridian, after all, and benzene's 254 nm band is the workhorse of every
undergraduate UV lab. "Forbidden" evidently does not mean silent. It means the
*leading term* vanishes: the integral is zero for a molecule frozen at its
symmetric equilibrium geometry, interacting with light through the electric
dipole term only, with spin decoupled from space. Each of those clauses is an
approximation, and each has a leak.

The biggest leak is that molecules do not sit still. A vibrating molecule
spends most of its time *away* from the symmetric geometry the selection rule
was derived at; an asymmetric vibration transiently destroys the inversion
center, and during that excursion the transition borrows a little intensity
from allowed bands nearby. This is **vibronic coupling**, worked out by
Herzberg and Teller in 1933 [@Herzberg1933Vibronic], and it is the mechanism
behind most of what you actually see in a "forbidden" band: the $d$–$d$ colors
of octahedral complexes and benzene's 254 nm band alike are vibronically
stolen intensity, which is why that benzene band appears not as one peak but as
a comb of vibrational sub-bands riding the enabling vibration. The stolen goods
are meager — a hundred here, a few thousand there, against the tens of
thousands of a truly allowed band — which is exactly the spacing of the
ladder's rungs.

The other leaks are quieter. Spin–orbit coupling entangles spin with space and
lets spin-forbidden transitions proceed feebly — fast in heavy atoms, glacial
in light ones, which is why Mn²⁺ stays nearly colorless while iodine-containing
phosphors glow efficiently. Static distortions do permanently what vibrations
do transiently: a crystal site squeezed away from perfect octahedral symmetry
is a little bit allowed all the time. And the electric dipole is only the first
term of the light–matter interaction; magnetic-dipole and electric-quadrupole
terms have their own, opposite selection rules ($g \rightarrow g$ allowed!),
just weaker by factors of $10^5$ or so — visible mainly when the dipole channel
is fully closed. The practical summary: **forbidden transitions are weak, not
absent, and how weak tells you which leak feeds them.**

## The same gate, one floor up

One more payoff, and it closes a loop with the other half of this blog's
science series. The parity argument of Figure 2 applies to any observable, not
just transition dipoles. The **first hyperpolarizability** $\beta$ — the
molecular quantity the [Pockels-effect post](/posts/2026-07-03-one-matrix-element-absorptivity-and-the-pockels-effect.html)
measured and the [RLC post](/posts/2026-07-06-molecules-as-circuits-rlc-resonator.html)
spent five sections trying to wire into a circuit — carries three spatial
indices, so under inversion it flips sign three times: $\beta \rightarrow
-\beta$. In a centrosymmetric molecule, $\beta$ must equal its own negative.
**Every centrosymmetric molecule has $\beta = 0$ identically** — the Laporte
rule, one floor up. That is why every chromophore in the electro-optics
literature is a donor–bridge–acceptor asymmetric by construction, and why a
poled film loses its electro-optic response the moment its chromophores
disorder back toward a centrosymmetric average: symmetry does not merely mute
the response, it erases it. The dial from forbidden to allowed that the
pigments post drew for absorption is the same dial the nonlinear-optics
posts turn when they break a molecule's symmetry on purpose.

So the pigment series' promissory note cashes out to this: a spectrum has two
independent axes, and symmetry owns one of them outright. The energy gap — set
by conjugation length, ligand field, charge-transfer distance — decides *where*
a band sits, and the [whole pigment taxonomy](/posts/2026-07-04-the-physics-and-chemistry-of-pigments.html)
is a catalogue of ways to place it. Whether the band is a whisper or a shout is
a different question with a different owner: one integral, zero or not,
adjudicated by the symmetry operations of the molecule in a table you can fit
on an index card. Viridian is pale because an octahedron has a center; cobalt
blue tints strongly because a tetrahedron doesn't; YInMn was engineered by
choosing a site where the gate stands open [@SmithSubramanian2009;
@nassau2001physics]. Forbidden or allowed is not a fact about what light wants
to do — it is a fact about what a shape permits.

*This post states selection rules in their leading-order electric-dipole form;
the leak terms — vibronic, spin–orbit, multipolar — are treated qualitatively,
and the representative absorptivities in Figure 3 are textbook order-of-magnitude
values for aqueous complexes and vapor/solution benzene, not precision data.
