# The shelf — open questions and unexplained observations

Every Research note's question lives here, with its contribution sentence and
falsifier — added in the same PR as the post is fine (`blog-authoring.md` §0).
This is a lab notebook, not a content calendar: entries are logged **when the
anomaly happens**, before there is an explanation. The explanation is the post.

Three sources feed it — **anomalies** (didn't reproduce, didn't match,
surprised you), **standing** (your published work, your methods, data only you
can see), and **next steps** (every Conclusion names the next experiment; that
sentence lands here).

An entry is ready to pull when it has a candidate `contribution:` sentence and a
falsifier. Until then it is an observation, which is fine — most entries sit for
a while, and the shelf is supposed to be deeper than the cadence.

Format:

```

## Neumaier decay in the canonical FP-nonassociativity demo
- **Observed:** He's published snippet returns 102 unique sums on CPython 3.13.12
  and would return 258 on ≤3.11 — `sum()` became Neumaier-compensated in 3.12
  (gh-100425). On all-float input the demo's phenomenon vanishes entirely (1
  unique result). It survives only because the source's array literal mixes an
  `int` `1` with floats.
- **Source:** He & Thinking Machines Lab, *Defeating Nondeterminism in LLM Inference* (2025)
- **Type:** decay
- **Status:** published — `/posts/2026-07-16-temperature-zero-is-not-determinism.html`

## Does the Neumaier change silently break other published FP demos?
- **Observed:** Generalizes the above. A large body of teaching material and blog
  writing demonstrates float non-associativity via Python's builtin `sum()`. Any
  of it written pre-2023 and run post-3.12 now measures a compensated
  accumulator. Unknown how many such demos are affected, or how many now print
  something other than what their prose claims.
- **Source:** the corpus of FP-nonassociativity demos; CPython gh-100425
- **Type:** decay (survey)
- **Contribution (candidate):** a measured count of how many widely-circulated
  demos silently changed behaviour at 3.12 — which nobody has enumerated
- **Falsifier:** nearly all such demos avoid builtin `sum` (use numpy/torch/explicit
  loops), making the effect a curiosity rather than a systematic decay
- **Status:** observation — needs a corpus before it is a question

## The unplotted line: divergence rate vs batch size
- **Observed:** He reports a single point — 1,000 completions at temperature zero
  gave 80 unique outputs, diverging at token 103. The *shape* of the relationship
  between batch size and divergence onset is never plotted, though it is the
  paper's own mechanism.
- **Source:** He & Thinking Machines Lab (2025)
- **Type:** unplotted line
- **Contribution (candidate):** divergence onset as a function of batch size,
  which the source asserts a mechanism for but never measures
- **Falsifier:** onset is flat in batch size, or dominated by prompt rather than batch
- **Blocked on:** a GPU. Rentable; not owned. Do not report as first-hand without one.
- **Status:** observation

## SIREN's underperformance in Villatoro et al. may be an initialization artifact
- **Observed:** §2.3.2 records that "the official SIREN Python implementation's
  initialization ... [differs from] the initialization scheme described in [32]",
  states "the network is sensitive to how it is initialized", and then adopts a
  *third* scheme from [35] without measuring what any of it costs. Separately they
  test ω₀ ∈ {5,10,20}, report "no meaningful difference", and then **run at ω₀=30 —
  a value outside the range they tested**. SIREN folklore holds ω₀ is *the*
  critical knob; "insensitive to ω₀" and "sensitive to initialization" are in
  tension. A load-bearing conclusion rests on this: "SIREN networks ... generally
  underperform relative to KAN and MLP."
- **Source:** Villatoro, Geraci & Schiavazzi, *J. Comput. Phys.* **565** (2026) 115170, §2.3.2 / §4
- **Type:** quantification (asserted sensitivity, never measured) → possible falsification
- **Contribution (candidate):** the measured cost of the SIREN paper-vs-repo
  initialization discrepancy in the multi-fidelity setting, and ω₀ sensitivity
  across {5,10,20,30} — neither of which the paper measures, though its
  SIREN-underperforms conclusion depends on both
- **Falsifier:** all three init schemes and all four ω₀ produce statistically
  indistinguishable HF MSE on K1–K4 → the discrepancy is cosmetic, SIREN's
  underperformance is architectural, and the paper's conclusion stands unharmed
- **Publish the other outcome?** Yes — "SIREN really does underperform, and here
  is the sensitivity data proving it isn't the init" is the useful null result
  the paper skipped.
- **Feasibility:** high. 1D closed-form test pair (eq. 4, the Forrester-type
  function), nets of 1×8 to 3×16, CPU-only. Paper's own runs: 180–230 s/train.
- **Status:** published — `/posts/2026-07-17-the-siren-that-was-a-straight-line.html`.
  Mechanism half only. Measured: specified scheme gives hidden pre-activation std
  0.036 vs ≈1 for both Sitzmann conventions at ω₀=30, compounding to 0.0018 by
  layer 2. Narrowed on the way: `siren-pytorch` [35] passes ONE w0 to both its
  initializer and its activation, so the degenerate config is nearly unreachable
  from the library — the defect is in the paper's prose, not necessarily its
  results. Did NOT claim otherwise. The cost half is the next entry.

## Does the SIREN spec degeneracy actually cost accuracy?
- **Observed:** Next step from the post above. A preliminary numpy training pilot
  (3×16, K1 HF, Adam, 15k epochs, **fixed lr=1e-3**, 4 reps) suggested the
  degenerate network *outperforms* both intact schemes at ω₀=30 — e.g. N_H=32:
  specified 5.1e-5 vs described 1.3e-2 vs official 1.6e-1 normalized MSE. Plausible
  reading: a linear hidden stack is fewer effective DOF, which regularizes in the
  8–32-sample regime where a true high-frequency SIREN overfits.
- **Why it is not yet a result:** the pilot is confounded. The paper tunes lr per
  configuration with Hyperopt over log[1e-5,1e-1]; at fixed lr a network that
  *fails to train* is indistinguishable from one that *overfits*, and the intact
  schemes scored >1.0 normalized MSE at ω₀=30, which smells like optimization
  failure rather than overfitting. Not reported in the post for that reason.
- **Source:** own next step; Villatoro et al. (2026) §2.7 (Hyperopt protocol)
- **Type:** quantification
- **Contribution (candidate):** the accuracy cost of the specification degeneracy
  under per-configuration lr tuning — i.e. whether the linear hidden stack helps
  or hurts once the optimizer confound is removed
- **Falsifier:** with lr tuned per config, intact and degenerate schemes reach
  statistically indistinguishable test MSE → the degeneracy is accuracy-neutral
  and the post's finding stays purely a specification defect
- **Needs:** an lr sweep per config (~4×the pilot's compute, still minutes), and
  ideally the MF architecture rather than single-fidelity HF fitting, since the
  paper's SIREN claim is about the MF setting
- **Blocked on (soft):** the authors' repo, to check spec-vs-code. Unreleased as of
  2026-07-16 ("shared upon acceptance"; accepted 2026-06-29).
- **Status:** ready — the sweep RAN 2026-07-17 (324 trainings, 3 schemes × 3 N_H ×
  4 reps × 9 lrs) but with the regularization penalties fixed at 0, which confounds
  it on K1 (the affine branch alone represents y_H; the penalty is how the paper's
  config wins). Headline withheld for that reason. The sweep's side product — the
  two Sitzmann conventions separating at fixed lr — became the convention post
  (next entry). Re-run needs the penalty search restored.

## The two Sitzmann conventions separated under training
- **Observed:** In the confounded sweep above, the two Sitzmann conventions —
  which the morning post had just called "numerically equivalent", and which are
  the same function at initialization to one part in 1e16 — separated by a factor
  of 3 in test error at fixed lr.
- **Source:** own sweep; `/posts/2026-07-17-the-siren-that-was-a-straight-line.html`
- **Type:** falsification (of my own published claim, same day)
- **Status:** published — `/posts/2026-07-17-why-the-two-siren-conventions-train-differently.html`.
  Mechanism: Adam's step is fixed-size in parameter space and the official
  convention stores hidden weights ω₀× smaller, so equal lr is an ω₀×-larger
  function-space step. Hidden-lr ×30 reproduces official to 3.5e-5 relative at
  lr=1e-5; first-fit lr on K1 shifts 10× in 3/4 seeds, 3.16× in 1/4. Two next
  steps below.

## Is the convention gap exactly 30 on the isolated hidden stack?
- **Observed:** The mechanism predicts a per-layer factor of ω₀=30 on the hidden
  layers; the measured first-fit lr gap is 10 (median of 4 seeds). Candidate
  dilution: the first layer and readout are shared and unscaled, and do some of
  the fitting.
- **Source:** own next step; the convention post's Conclusion
- **Type:** quantification
- **Contribution (candidate):** freeze the first layer and readout, re-run the
  lr sweep on the isolated hidden stack — if it returns 30, the dilution is
  quantified rather than asserted
- **Falsifier:** the isolated hidden stack still returns ~10 → the dilution story
  is wrong and a second mechanism is present
- **Status:** ready

## Can LLMs apply a music-analytic rubric repeatably without recognizing the work?
- **Observed:** Greenberg's analyses of early off-tonic recapitulations discuss
  mechanisms that we synthesize into six potentially operational cues--tonal
  stability, thematic correspondence, preparation, proportional location,
  rhetorical emphasis, and rotational continuation. The six-cue 0--4 rubric is
  investigator-authored; Greenberg did not propose or validate it. Turning
  those cues into an LLM annotation task creates two
  prior measurement problems: repeated runs may not agree, and an identity-withheld
  canonical score may still be identifiable from model training. Neither is
  tested by Greenberg, and a model comparison cannot by itself adjudicate his
  historical or perceptual claim.
- **Source:** Yoel Greenberg, "The Off-Tonic Recapitulation in Context: a Study
  in Fuzziness," *Music Analysis* **44** (2025) 372--392,
  doi:10.1111/musa.12251.
- **Type:** composition (music-analytic rubric x LLM annotation reliability)
- **Contribution (candidate):** a repeated cross-system measurement spanning
  two provider families of whether LLMs apply one explicit music-analytic
  rubric consistently, paired with a direct probe of elicited repertoire
  identification--which is not in
  Greenberg and is normally assumed away in identity-withheld canonical-
  repertoire tasks; identification cannot by itself establish training-data
  provenance or memorization
- **Hypothesis:** on a six-dossier pilot, at least two of three model systems,
  spanning both tested provider families, will achieve ordinal alpha at least
  0.67, mean pairwise score difference at most 0.50, and at least 90% within-one
  agreement; no target dossier will yield an exact work-and-movement
  identification, while the intended identification-sensitivity anchor will
  yield repeated within-system or both-family exact identification.
- **Falsifier:** fewer than two model systems spanning both provider families
  meet all repeatability thresholds,
  any target work and movement is exactly identified, the positive control is
  not detected, or the rubric is degenerate across cases.
- **Publish the other outcome?** Yes--unstable ratings, stable model-specific
  disagreement, or successful repertoire identification would each change how
  LLM annotation should be designed and interpreted in humanities research.
- **Primary outcome:** within-system repeatability across three fresh-context
  runs, cross-system reliability after repetition medians, schema/missingness
  rates, and a separately run identification probe. The continuum question is
  deferred and cannot be inferred from six cases. The model matrix is a partial
  2x2 panel--OpenAI frontier and active prior-generation plus Anthropic
  frontier--so pooled results double-weight OpenAI and generation comparisons
  remain descriptive rather than causal.
- **GATE:** freeze two focal, three tonic-control, and one off-tonic positive-
  control dossier; disclose the resulting imbalance and the deferred Clementi
  extension; freeze two task prompts, exact model systems, all hashes, the
  ordinal-alpha implementation, completeness/dispersion/identification rules,
  and the full 108-call schedule before the first real-case output is viewed.
- **Status:** published —
  `/posts/2026-07-19-repeatable-but-not-blind.html`. The hypothesis was
  falsified for automatic expansion: the two complete passing systems came
  from one provider family, cue dispersion reached 0/6 (2/6 post hoc), all
  three systems exactly identified K. 576/i, and two target work-level
  recognition self-reports occurred; the K. 545 sensitivity condition passed

## Off-tonic dataset 2.0: does fixing the design preserve the stability?
- **Observed:** The 1.0.0 pilot was repeatable but not blind: the frozen
  validator rejected five complete Anthropic responses over two unstated
  constraints, the primary set had no off-tonic anchor (Clementi deferred on
  source verification), K. 576 survived normalization as an identity transform
  and was the only exactly identified target, and the panel gave OpenAI two of
  three positions.
- **Source:** own next step; the off-tonic pilot post's Conclusion
- **Type:** untested regime (revised design under the same estimands)
- **Contribution (candidate):** a re-frozen run with an expert-verifiable
  off-tonic primary anchor, a prompt-aligned preflighted output contract, a
  representation that reduces identity recovery or models familiarity as an
  explicit factor, and a provider-balanced panel
- **Falsifier:** the revised design loses the observed test–retest stability
  (any previously passing system drops below the frozen α/MAD/within-one
  thresholds), or identity recovery persists across the changed representation
- **Status:** observation — blocked on expert-readable source verification for
  Clementi Op. 10 No. 3/i (or another off-tonic anchor) before any re-freeze

## SGD control: does the convention gap become ω₀² = 900?
- **Observed:** Corrected prediction from the convention post (an earlier draft
  said SGD is invariant here — backwards): SGD's step is proportional to the
  gradient, which is ω₀× larger for the official convention, and lands on a
  weight the forward pass scales by ω₀ again — effective factor ω₀² = 900, exact
  for SGD with no ε caveat.
- **Source:** own next step; the convention post's Conclusion
- **Type:** untested regime
- **Falsifier:** the measured SGD gap is far from 900 (null, or ~30) → the
  parameter-space-step picture of the mechanism is wrong
- **Status:** published —
  `/posts/2026-07-18-the-sgd-control-900-on-the-hidden-stack.html`. The isolated
  hidden-stack displacement ratio is 899.86 at lr=1e-8, while a direct
  shared/hidden decomposition and a 0.05-decade full-network sweep resolve no
  convention-dependent global learning-rate gap on K1.

## Does momentum change the full-network dilution under SGD?
- **Observed:** Plain SGD preserves the predicted isolated hidden-stack factor
  of ω₀²=900, but K1's shared parameters dominate the one-step displacement and
  both conventions select the same best tested global learning rate. Momentum
  remains linear in the gradient, so 900 should survive on the isolated stack;
  its effect on the shared-to-hidden balance over a full trajectory is unknown.
- **Source:** own next step; the SGD-control post's Conclusion
- **Type:** untested regime
- **Contribution (candidate):** measure isolated and full-network convention
  gaps under SGD with momentum, including a direct velocity/displacement
  decomposition
- **Falsifier:** the isolated common-rate factor falls outside 800–1000 or the
  ×900 trajectory differs by more than 1e-10 relative; the described
  shared-to-hidden balance changes by more than a factor of two between β=0 and
  β=0.9; or the conventions select different best rates on the refined grid
- **Status:** published — `/posts/2026-07-19-the-momentum-control.html`.
  Isolated ×900 survives (900.006 in the small-step limit; ×900 hidden-rate
  reparameterization ends 6.4e-16 apart relative to the output scale over 200
  steps at β=0.9), and the
  linear-regime balance changes by less than 2% from β=0 to β=0.9. All three
  registered falsifiers fired: F1 and F2 at settings where output displacement
  had saturated, and F3 because one official repetition selected a rate two
  grid steps below the described convention on the numerical error floor.
  Unpredicted: the stability boundary and modal best rate move up by 1.995 ≈
  1+β, and at β=0.9 the described convention reaches the official error floor
  at exactly one tested rate, the last finite grid point before divergence.

## How wide is the described convention's momentum recovery region in beta?
- **Observed:** At β=0.9 the described SIREN convention reaches the official
  convention's error floor (approximately 1e-28 normalized MSE on K1) at
  exactly one tested 0.05-decade grid point, immediately below the divergence
  boundary at 1.412538e-3. Two grid points below its best rate it remains about
  twenty orders of magnitude above the official error. The official convention
  stays below 2.5e-27 across the whole 0.6-decade finite grid. Whether the set
  of rates at which the described convention recovers widens, narrows, or
  vanishes as β varies is unmeasured; the quadratic heavy-ball bound
  2(1+β)/L suggests a roughly 1+β boundary shift for this network (measured
  1.995 at β=0.9).
- **Source:** own next step; `/posts/2026-07-19-the-momentum-control.html`
- **Type:** quantification
- **Contribution (candidate):** the recovery-region width as a function of β ∈
  {0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 0.99}, at 0.05-decade or finer resolution — the curve that
  says whether momentum's rescue of the described convention is usable or a
  knife-edge
- **Falsifier:** the width does not vary monotonically with β, or the described
  convention reaches the floor at no tested rate for some β > 0.5
- **Status:** published — `/posts/2026-08-11-momentum-recovery-region.html`.
  Falsified as registered: stage-1 recovery counts over β ∈ {0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9,
  0.99} are 0, 0, 0, 1, 12 — no recovery at β=0.6 fires the second clause.
  Refined widths: 0.03 decades at β=0.9 (knife-edge at the boundary) and ≥0.68
  decades at β=0.99 (low-rate plateau, censored below 7.9e-5). The divergence
  boundary tracks 1+β within a grid step through β=0.9 (1.000, 1.413, 1.585,
  1.995) then collapses to 1.000 at β=0.99, with an explosive finite-error
  band (to 7.6e+71) below it. Two next steps below.

## What breaks the heavy-ball boundary rule between β = 0.9 and 0.99?
- **Observed:** the described/official divergence boundary on K1 tracks the
  quadratic heavy-ball bound 2(1+β)/L within one 0.05-decade grid step from
  β=0 through β=0.9 (ratios 1.000, 1.413, 1.585, 1.995 vs 1, 1.3, 1.6, 1.9),
  then falls back to exactly the plain-SGD boundary at β=0.99 (ratio 1.000 vs
  predicted 1.99), while the region below it fills with explosive finite
  errors (median up to 1.5e+67 at lr=6.9e-4; single reps reach 7.6e+71).
  Either the effective curvature L moves with β, or the first-diverging mode
  changes — unmeasured.
- **Source:** own next step; `/posts/2026-08-11-momentum-recovery-region.html`
- **Type:** unplotted line / quantification
- **Contribution (candidate):** the top-curvature trajectory at β=0.9 vs
  β=0.99 (Lanczos on the loss Hessian along the run), identifying which
  premise of the quadratic bound fails — the mechanism the boundary series
  asserts but never measures
- **Falsifier:** the tracked curvature predicts the β=0.99 boundary under the
  quadratic bound after all (i.e. L moves and fully accounts for the
  collapse) → no mode change, and the 1+β rule was never really working
- **Status:** ready

## Where is the β=0.99 recovery plateau's lower edge?
- **Observed:** at β=0.99 the described convention sits on the official error
  floor from the measured window's bottom (7.94e-5) up to 3.55e-4 — 68
  adjacent 0.01-decade points, uniform across 3 reps — so the 0.68-decade
  width is a lower bound, censored by the grid.
- **Source:** own next step; `/posts/2026-08-11-momentum-recovery-region.html`
- **Type:** quantification
- **Contribution (candidate):** the plateau's full width, from a downward grid
  extension at β=0.99 until the median leaves the floor — turning the
  censored lower bound into a measured width
- **Falsifier:** the plateau extends below any practical rate floor (still on
  the error floor at, say, 1e-6) → the "region" is effectively unbounded
  below and the width question was the wrong framing
- **Status:** ready

## Does nonlinear cross-correlation expose the SGD convention gap?
- **Observed:** K1 obeys y_H=2y_L-20x+20, so its affine branch can carry the fit
  while the convention-scaled SIREN hidden stack remains secondary. A nonlinear
  K-case removes that escape route.
- **Source:** own next step; the SGD-control post's Conclusion
- **Type:** untested regime
- **Contribution (candidate):** repeat the direct decomposition and refined SGD
  sweep on a K-case whose high/low-fidelity correlation requires the nonlinear
  branch. Add the momentum control's β=0.9 arm to test whether the described
  convention's one-point recovery at the edge of stability survives once the
  affine branch can no longer carry the fit.
- **Falsifier:** the two conventions still have no resolvable network-level
  learning-rate gap after the affine branch can no longer represent the target
- **Status:** ready

## Does the NTK mechanism actually predict Table 5?
- **Observed:** §2.4 attributes encoding's benefit to NTK eigenspectrum reshaping
  ("NTK-based analysis [51] *suggests* ... allowing the network to represent
  high-frequency components of F that are otherwise suppressed by spectral bias")
  and confirms only the *outcome*, never the mechanism — no NTK is ever computed.
  §4 makes a further spectral claim qualitatively: KAN good across all frequency
  ranges, MLP preferential for low-frequency, SIREN for high-frequency
  oscillation. Meanwhile **Table 5 is a published 15-case ledger of exactly where
  encoding helped (K3, K4, 2DU, GJG9) and where it hurt or was unnecessary (K1,
  K5)**. The hypothesis predicts that ledger. Nobody has checked whether it does.
  §5 concedes the theory "remains an open problem".
- **Source:** Villatoro, Geraci & Schiavazzi (2026), §2.4 / Table 5 / §5
- **Type:** unplotted line
- **Contribution (candidate):** measured NTK eigenspectra for encoded vs
  unencoded MF networks, tested against the paper's own published help/hurt
  ledger — the mechanism the paper asserts from a citation and never computes
- **Falsifier:** encoding leaves the eigenspectrum statistically unchanged, or
  the spectral shift does not track Table 5's help/hurt column (i.e. it fails to
  predict that encoding *harms* K1 and is unnecessary for K5)
- **Feasibility:** medium. Tiny nets make the NTK Gram cheap; MLP and SIREN are
  straightforward (Jacobian outer products), KAN is not — scope to MLP+SIREN and
  say so.
- **Risk:** the metric choice (effective rank vs eigenvalue decay exponent) is a
  judgement call and must be fixed *before* running, or this becomes curve-fitting.
- **Status:** ready

## How slowly must you pump an anomalous soliton before quantization breaks?
- **Observed:** Tao, Wang & Xu report a new *anomalous* nonlinear Thouless pump —
  a soliton displaced by 0, −2 or −3 unit cells per cycle while the Bloch band it
  comes from has Chern number −1. The mechanism is a transition between Wannier
  functions **by passing through an intersite-soliton state**. Adiabaticity is
  asserted and never quantified: "in the adiabatic limit—where θ is varied very
  slowly", "when θ is varied **sufficiently slowly** ... the results **closely
  resemble** the instantaneous solutions". **No pump period T appears anywhere in
  the paper**, and no displacement-vs-ramp-rate curve is plotted.
- **Why the gap is glaring:** quantization breakdown is an established subfield the
  paper itself cites three times — Walter et al., *Quantization and its breakdown
  in a Hubbard–Thouless pump* (Nat. Phys. 19, 1471, 2023) [10]; Fu et al.,
  *Nonlinear Thouless pumping: solitons and transport breakdown* (PRL 128, 154101,
  2022) [37]; Tuloup et al., *Breakdown of quantization in nonlinear Thouless
  pumping* (New J. Phys. 25, 083048, 2023) [40]. They introduce a new pumping
  mechanism and never ask where *its* quantization breaks.
- **Physical reason to expect a difference:** the anomalous pump routes through an
  intersite-soliton state — a bifurcation where solution branches nearly touch.
  Adiabatic following through a near-degeneracy is exactly where it should be
  fragile. The normal pump (following a single Wannier function) has no such
  passage.
- **Source:** Tao, Wang & Xu, *Nat. Commun.* (2026), doi:10.1038/s41467-026-73460-y
  (Article in Press, accepted 2026-05-13)
- **Type:** unplotted line / quantification
- **Contribution (candidate):** the critical pump period for quantized anomalous
  soliton transport, and whether it exceeds the normal pump's — which the paper
  asserts as "sufficiently slowly" and never measures, in a mechanism it proposes
  for cold-atom experiment
- **Falsifier:** the critical pump period T_c is the same, within a factor of ~2,
  for the normal case (g=g₁₂=m₀=1, displacement −1) and the anomalous case
  (g=1, g₁₂=0, m₀=1, displacement −2). The anomalous mechanism then carries no
  extra adiabaticity cost and the paper's silence is harmless.
- **Publish the other outcome?** Yes — "the anomalous pump is no more fragile than
  the normal one" is directly useful to the experimentalists they are pitching
  (they propose a ⁷Li BEC, 1316 atoms, a_s ≈ −1.43 nm, a = 532 nm, ω_⊥ = 2π×710 Hz),
  since experiments have finite coherence time. A null here is a green light.
- **Stakes:** they argue the effect "can be experimentally observed". Any adiabatic
  protocol has to fit inside a coherence budget. If the anomalous pump needs 10×
  the normal pump's ramp, that is a design constraint nobody has stated.
- **Feasibility:** high, numpy-only. Fully specified discrete model:
  Eq. (2) H^lin(k) = (m_z + J₁cos k)σ_z + J'₁ sin k σ_y + J₂σ_x, with
  m_z = m₀ + cos θ, J₁ = J'₁ = 1, J₂ = sin θ; Eq. (1) DNLS with
  V_σj = g|ψ_σj|² + g₁₂|ψ_σ̄j|²; N = 1.45. ~40–80 sites × 2 components.
  Needs a hand-rolled Newton solver (no scipy) + RK4/split-step integrator.
- **Source data is declared but NOT reachable (checked 2026-07-16).** The paper
  cites Figshare doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.32182566 [65], but the DOI 404s, the
  Figshare API 404s on both the DOI and the article id, and a title search returns
  zero hits — presumably embargoed until the Article in Press becomes final. My
  earlier note that the data "IS released" was wrong. The gate therefore cannot be
  checked against their numbers and must stand on independent validation of the
  model instead (Chern numbers; Wannier centers at l+1/2; the exact flat-band
  solution at theta=pi). Same shape as the SIREN post's unreleased code: declared
  available, not actually reachable.
- **GATE (do this before anything else):** reproduce Fig. 2a's four displacements —
  −1 (black: g=g₁₂=m₀=1), 0 (blue: g=−1, g₁₂=0, m₀=1), −2 (red: g=1, g₁₂=0, m₀=1),
  −3 (gold: g=1, g₁₂=0, m₀=1.3). If the baseline does not reproduce, stop and
  report; a T_c measured against a wrong soliton is worthless.
- **Caveat:** "Article in Press", unedited — "there may be errors present which
  affect the content". Fine for a physics-of-the-model question; would NOT support
  a text-vs-code claim like the SIREN post, since the text is not final.
- **Status:** published — `/posts/2026-07-17-how-slowly-must-you-pump-an-anomalous-soliton.html`.
  **Numbers below are the CONVERGED rerun** (2026-07-17) after a code review (Codex +
  a Claude review) caught that the first version built Table 3 from a single
  under-resolved dt=0.03 scan. H **supported**: T_c = 1200 (normal) vs 5200
  (anomalous), ratio 4.33, outside the factor-of-2 falsifier. Above threshold the
  normal pump leaves the ±0.15 band once in 28 (T=9200, by 0.19); the anomalous pump
  leaves it 9 of 18, worst +0.35 at T=9200 (a −2 pump moving the wrong way), scatter
  13× larger. Both pumps deviate most at T=9200 → resonance fingerprint (next entry).
  Reproduced 3 of 4 displacements (−1, 0, −2); case 3 (−3) not reproduced — see below.
  Lesson recorded: [[reference-numerics-check-the-integrator-first]] — right
  integrator, wrong step size, table built from a coarser scan than the spot-check.

## What sets the anomalous pump's excursion periods?
- **Observed:** Next step from the post above. The anomalous displacement leaves the
  quantized value at specific periods (T = 7600–11200, worst +0.35 at T=9200 — a −2
  pump nudging the soliton the wrong way) and returns to −1.96 by T=12000 —
  deterministic (a 1e-8 initial perturbation moves it by 0.0000), dt-converged under
  4th-order Yoshida, and with the soliton intact (|z| > 0.87 throughout). So it is a
  smooth function of T with structure, not noise.
- **Candidate mechanism:** a resonance between the pump frequency 2π/T and the
  splitting between the soliton branches that nearly touch at θ=π. That splitting is
  computable from the Jacobian of the stationary problem, which
  `downloads/soliton-pump-code.tar.gz` already builds.
- **Source:** own next step; Tao, Wang & Xu (2026)
- **Type:** unplotted line
- **Contribution (candidate):** the rule that predicts which pump periods fail —
  turning "pump slowly enough" into a list of periods to avoid, which is what an
  experimentalist actually needs
- **Falsifier (fix before running):** the excursion periods show no relation to any
  integer multiple of the branch splitting → the resonance picture is wrong and the
  structure has another origin
- **Needs:** the stationary Jacobian's spectrum near θ=π, and a finer T grid than
  400 to resolve excursion widths
- **Status:** ready

## Why does case 3 (m0=1.3, displacement −3) not reproduce at all?
- **Observed:** From the post above. Every period tested gives values nowhere near
  −3; at T=9600 it converges to −19.33 across dt = 0.04/0.02/0.01, i.e. the soliton
  slides ~19 cells per cycle. Not a convergence failure and not delocalization
  (|z| ≈ 0.95).
- **Likely cause:** the θ=0 branch I seed (staggered envelope, μ = −1.1375,
  participation 6.49) may not be the branch the authors follow. The paper notes case
  3's window is narrow (0 ≤ g12 ≤ 0.01 at m0=1.3), so branch identity matters more here.
- **Type:** falsification (of my own reproduction, first) — resolve before claiming
  anything about the paper
- **Needs:** pseudo-arclength continuation through the branch point to trace which
  instantaneous branch connects to θ=0, rather than naive θ-stepping (which jumps
  branches near θ=π — observed: max|Δx| per step 0.44 at dθ=0.0044)
- **Status:** observation

## Does anything I report depend on the bits that moved?
- **Observed:** The closing question of the temperature-zero note, unanswered and
  currently rhetorical. It is only a real question against a specific reported
  number — an eval delta, an estimate, a measured constant.
- **Source:** `/posts/2026-07-16-temperature-zero-is-not-determinism.html` (own next step)
- **Type:** quantification
- **Falsifier:** the reported quantity is stable across reruns to more digits than are quoted
- **Status:** observation — needs a concrete target before it is a question

## Does the h/p-adaptive SPH speedup reach an order of magnitude at equal accuracy?
- **Observed:** Ricci, Vacondio, and Fourtakas state that their h/p-adaptive SPH
  formulation reduces cost by up to an order of magnitude. In the three-dimensional
  vortex-ring case they identify two equal-accuracy resolution pairs in prose and
  report the corresponding normalized run times in a separate table, but never join
  those values into equal-accuracy speedups.
- **Source:** Ricci, Vacondio, and Fourtakas, *J. Comput. Phys.* **565** (2026)
  115192, Table 3 and the paragraph immediately below it
- **Type:** quantification
- **Contribution (candidate):** an equal-accuracy cost ledger for the paper's two
  explicit vortex-ring resolution matches, which the source's own timing data
  supports but the source never calculates
- **Falsifier:** either matched pair gives a speedup of at least 10 when the reported
  normalized run times are divided
- **Publish the other outcome?** Yes — a measured tenfold saving would make the
  paper's headline claim more concrete rather than less useful.
- **Status:** drafting

## What is the full cost-accuracy Pareto frontier for h/p-adaptive SPH?
- **Observed:** Figure 8 of Ricci, Vacondio, and Fourtakas plots drag-history
  error against normalized wall-clock time for the impulsively started cylinder,
  but the plotted errors are not tabulated and the paper does not report the
  equal-error speedup along the curve.
- **Source:** Ricci, Vacondio, and Fourtakas, *J. Comput. Phys.* **565** (2026)
  115192, Figure 8 and Table 1
- **Type:** unplotted line
- **Contribution (candidate):** a pre-thresholded equal-error Pareto frontier for
  the cylinder runs, including the maximum supported speedup, which is not in
  the source
- **Falsifier:** the h/p curve does not Pareto-dominate the Lagrangian curve at
  the declared error threshold, or its maximum matched speedup remains below 10
- **Status:** observation — needs the authors' raw Figure 8 error values or a
  documented plot-digitization uncertainty model

## Over what bond-distance range does Coulomb subtraction help an ANN potential fit?
- **Observed:** Rana et al. report a useful physics-informed fitting strategy:
  subtract the exact nuclear-repulsion term from a molecular potential, fit the
  smoother electronic energy, and restore the exact term afterward. Their
  examples span curves and surfaces with different geometric domains, which
  makes the bond-distance dependence of that useful decomposition a natural
  next variable to isolate. The paper does not map fit performance against the
  shortest included internuclear distance.
- **Source:** Rana, Sankar Manoj, Lourderaj, and Sathyamurthy, *J. Comput. Chem.*
  **46** (2025) e70220, doi:10.1002/jcc.70220
- **Type:** quantification / untested regime
- **Contribution (candidate):** a matched-seed measurement of the bond-distance
  regime over which subtracting the exact 1/R nuclear repulsion improves an ANN
  fit to an H2+ potential curve, which the source does not report
- **Hypothesis:** the benefit is concentrated in the short-range Coulombic
  regime, so the median test-RMSD ratio RMSD(A)/RMSD(B) will move toward 1 as
  the smallest bond distances are removed
- **Falsifier:** the median ratio remains at least 2, without a downward trend,
  after all points below R = 1.5 a0 are removed
- **Publish the other outcome?** Yes — persistence outside the short-range
  regime would show that the residual fit has a broader numerical benefit than
  removal of the near-singular wall alone.
- **Scope boundary:** the article is CC BY and the Supporting Information is
  public, but the raw energy grids, MATLAB code, split indices, preprocessing,
  and random seeds are available only from the authors on request or are not
  specified. This will be an independent controlled test, not a numerical
  reproduction of the paper's tables.
- **Feasibility:** high. Generate a small H2+ curve with a one-electron quantum
  chemistry calculation; fit identical one-hidden-layer networks to total and
  electronic energies across matched splits, initializations, and distance
  cutoffs. CPU-only and laptop-scale.

## Does force training move the Coulomb-subtraction crossover?
- **Observed:** The H2+ cutoff experiment fits energies only. Its measured
  crossover is controlled by whether the fitted domain contains the short-range
  $1/R$ wall, while the corresponding nuclear force grows as $1/R^2$.
- **Source:** `/posts/2026-07-18-where-coulomb-subtraction-helps.md` (own next step)
- **Type:** untested regime
- **Contribution (candidate):** a matched energy-plus-force measurement of how
  differentiation changes the fitted-distance range over which exact Coulomb
  subtraction improves an H2+ neural potential
- **Hypothesis:** adding force labels moves the median A/B parity crossing to a
  larger $R_{\min}$ because Scheme A must approximate the steeper $1/R^2$
  nuclear-force contribution
- **Falsifier:** the first cutoff with median A/B at or below 1 is unchanged or
  moves to a smaller $R_{\min}$ under the predeclared energy-plus-force loss
- **Publish the other outcome?** Yes — it would separate an energy-conditioning
  effect from a general advantage under differentiation.
- **Status:** published —
  `/posts/2026-07-21-does-force-training-move-the-coulomb-subtraction-crossover.html`.
  Hypothesis **falsified**: the crossover moved inward, 3.00 → 2.00 a0, while the
  near-wall advantage widened (median A/B 53.37 → 1830.35 at R_min = 0.15 a0).
  The subtraction range is set by the energy target's short-range curvature;
  force labels amplify it locally without extending it. Next step below.

## Is the inward crossover shift monotonic in the force weight λ?
- **Observed:** Adding force labels at a single weight, λ = 1, moved the
  Coulomb-subtraction crossover *inward* (3.00 → 2.00 a0) on the minimal-basis
  H2+ curve, against the predeclared prediction, while widening the near-wall
  A/B gap to 1830× at R_min = 0.15 a0. Whether the inward shift is monotonic in
  λ — or whether at large force weight the direct scheme's near-wall failure
  ever re-extends the range over which subtraction wins — is unmeasured, and the
  8-point cutoff grid snaps the crossover to a grid point rather than
  bracketing it.
- **Source:** `/posts/2026-07-21-does-force-training-move-the-coulomb-subtraction-crossover.html`
  (own next step)
- **Type:** untested regime / quantification
- **Contribution (candidate):** the crossover cutoff as a function of λ across
  several decades on the same curve, with a finer cutoff grid so the crossover
  is bracketed rather than snapped — which neither the λ = 1 post nor Rana et
  al. measure
- **Falsifier:** the crossover cutoff is flat in λ over the tested decades — the
  λ = 1 shift is then a threshold effect, not a dose-response, and the
  energy-target story needs revisiting
- **Publish the other outcome?** Yes — a monotonic curve and a re-extension at
  large λ are each directly usable rules for choosing the force weight.
- **Also queued from the same Conclusion:** a curve whose high/low-fidelity
  branches force the nonlinear part of the network to carry the fit, testing
  whether the effect survives when the direct scheme cannot lean on a smooth
  total potential.
- **Status:** ready

## When do pulse-independent trajectories stop being pulse-independent?
- **Observed:** Galiana et al. reuse nuclear trajectories generated without an
  initial pump-generated electronic coherence, then repropagate only the
  electronic coefficients for each new broadband pulse. In their three-state
  glycine test, more than 90% of surface hops occur after 3 fs, when the relevant
  initial coherences have almost completely decayed. They explicitly leave the
  complementary regime untested: a wavepacket prepared at or near a conical
  intersection, where many hops can occur while the coherence is still alive.
- **Source:** Galiana et al., *J. Chem. Theory Comput.* **22** (2026) 1224–1243,
  doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01809; Grell et al., *Faraday Discuss.* (2026),
  doi:10.1039/D6FD00086J
- **Type:** untested regime / quantification
- **Contribution (candidate):** the validity boundary of pulse-independent
  trajectory reuse as the fraction of surface hops occurring before electronic
  decoherence is increased, which neither 2026 source measures
- **Hypothesis:** repropagation error is controlled by the overlap between
  surviving pump-generated coherence and surface hopping: population,
  coherence, and nuclear-observable errors will rise with the fraction of hops
  that occur before the coherence has decayed
- **Falsifier:** pulse-independent repropagation remains within 5 percentage
  points in state populations and 0.1 initial nuclear standard deviations in
  nuclear centroids even when at least half of all hops occur before the
  coherence magnitude falls to 1/e of its initial value, or its error has no
  positive association with that early-hop fraction
- **Publish the other outcome?** Yes — robustness in the early-hop regime would
  materially strengthen the method's advertised use for broadband-pulse control
  studies near conical intersections.
- **Primary outcome:** the full-propagation versus repropagation error in a
  product-side nuclear population or branching observable. Electronic
  populations and coherences are secondary outcomes; population agreement alone
  does not pass the test.
- **GATE (before the sweep):** reproduce a published coherent-state
  conical-intersection benchmark on the same two-state vibronic-coupling
  Hamiltonian. At minimum, match one reported population trace and one nuclear
  observable under time-step, grid/ensemble-size, and seed convergence. If the
  baseline does not reproduce, stop rather than assigning its discrepancy to
  pulse-independent repropagation.
- **GATE REFINEMENT (before data):** the coherent BMA panel in Mannouch and
  Kelly reports the upper-adiabatic population but no nuclear observable. The
  published checks will therefore be (1) that BMA population trace and (2) the
  coherent 1D nuclear-density bifurcation reported in the same paper. The BMA
  product-side population used in the new sweep will be benchmarked against
  independently converged exact grid dynamics; it will not be described as a
  previously published observable. This refinement was recorded before any
  simulation output was generated.
- **Operational definitions (before trajectory data):** stress the method by
  translating the initial BMA Gaussian toward the intersection while retaining
  its published widths, momenta, electronic state, and Hamiltonian. Use centers
  $q_{x,0}/(a/2)=1,0.75,0.5,0.25,0$; 20 fs trajectories; four predeclared seeds
  1701--1704; and 4000 Wigner geometries per seed. Define coherence survival as
  the ensemble mean of $2|c_-^*c_+|$ after PFM damping and its lifetime as the
  first crossing of $C(0)/e$. The early-hop fraction is the fraction of all
  successful full-propagation hops at or before that lifetime. Report the
  maximum-in-time absolute upper-state population error, product-side
  $P(q_x<0)$ error, and $q_x$-centroid error divided by the published initial
  $sigma_x$. Pulse-independent reuse counts as robust in the early-hop regime
  only if all three errors remain at or below 0.05, 0.05, and 0.1,
  respectively, for a case with early-hop fraction at least 0.5. Assess the
  predicted trend with the Spearman correlation between early-hop fraction and
  each error across the five centers. Use RP-AXE, PFM with momentum injection,
  a 0.05 fs nuclear step, five exact two-state electronic substeps, and verify
  the latter choices at $q_{x,0}/(a/2)=0.25$ against a 0.025 fs /
  ten-substep run before interpreting the sweep. For that paired 4000-geometry
  seed-1701 check, require the maximum population and product-side differences
  between numerical settings to be below 0.02 and the centroid difference to
  be below $0.03\sigma_x$.
- **Numerical-gate outcome (before the final sweep):** the 0.05 fs / five-
  substep and 0.025 fs / ten-substep seed-1701 runs differed by 0.0078 in the
  full upper population, 0.0083 in $P(q_x<0)$, and $0.0384\sigma_x$ in the full
  centroid. The first two criteria passed and the centroid criterion failed.
  All final runs will therefore use 0.025 fs and ten electronic substeps; the
  centroid tolerance was not relaxed.
- **Pilot-triggered extension (recorded before kicked-ensemble data):**
  1000-geometry runtime pilots at center fractions 0.25 and 0 produced early-
  hop fractions 0.262 and 0.254, respectively, so translating an undirected
  Wigner packet did not reach the planned 0.5 stress regime. Retain and report
  the original five-center sweep, then add a separately labeled adaptive sweep
  at $q_{x,0}/(a/2)=0.5$ with a mean momentum directed toward the intersection:
  $\langle p_x\rangle/\sigma_{p_x}=0,-0.5,-1,-1.5,-2$. Use the same four
  seeds, 4000 geometries, fine time step, observables, and thresholds. Treat
  trends from this directional-kick sweep as second-stage evidence, not as part
  of the original preregistered center-only test.
- **Feasibility:** medium. A two-state, two-dimensional linear-vibronic-coupling
  model is laptop-scale and permits an exact grid-based quantum reference, but
  the TSH-PFM decoherence and repropagation algorithms must be implemented or
  obtained in reproducible form.
- **Status:** drafting

## Can a conical-intersection model sustain a majority of hops before decoherence?
- **Observed:** The pulse-independent-trajectory stress test increased accepted
  surface hops by translating and directionally kicking the BMA packet, but the
  largest early-hop fraction was 0.263. Faster launch momentum also shortened
  the $C(0)/e$ lifetime and added later hops, so the predeclared 0.5 boundary
  remained untested.
- **Source:** `/posts/2026-07-18-when-pulse-independent-trajectories-lose-nuclear-accuracy.md`
  (own next step)
- **Type:** untested regime
- **Contribution (candidate):** an adjudicated validity test for RP-AXE in a
  regime where most accepted hops occur while the initial coherence survives
- **Hypothesis:** changing the diabatic coupling or initial coherence lifetime,
  while holding the launch distribution fixed, can raise the early-hop fraction
  above 0.5 without increasing the late-hop denominator as a momentum kick did
- **Falsifier:** no predeclared coupling/lifetime setting reaches an early-hop
  fraction of 0.5 under converged FP dynamics, or a reached setting keeps the
  FP--RP-AXE population, product, and centroid errors below 0.05, 0.05, and
  $0.1\sigma_x$
- **Publish the other outcome?** Yes — numerical robustness after a majority of
  coherence-overlapping hops would materially strengthen the reuse method.
- **Status:** inconclusive — post PR #54. The archived sweep measured mean
  single-trajectory coherence magnitude, while the phase-sensitive corrective
  sweep was blocked by its fine/finer centroid gate.

## Which numerical endpoint stabilizes the phase-sensitive coherence--hop test?
- **Observed:** The corrected BMA experiment retained signed ensemble
  density-matrix components and compared 0.0125 fs / twenty electronic
  substeps with 0.00625 fs / forty substeps at $s=0.05$ over eight paired
  seeds. Their pooled phase-sensitive early-hop fractions were 0.25744 and
  0.25711, and both were non-majority, but the centroid's maximum absolute 95%
  interval endpoint was $0.03860\sigma_x$ against the frozen
  $0.03\sigma_x$ limit. The gate therefore blocked the seven-scale production
  sweep. The old 28-run archive cannot answer this question because it stores
  only mean single-trajectory coherence magnitude.
- **Source:** own next step; post PR #54
- **Type:** quantification
- **Contribution (candidate):** a preregistered multi-seed convergence map for
  the signed ensemble-coherence components, accepted-event fraction, and FP
  nuclear observables that either identifies the first stable trajectory
  endpoint or quantifies the remaining numerical uncertainty under a fixed
  compute ceiling
- **Hypothesis:** one additional predeclared refinement level will bring every
  paired 95% interval endpoint within the existing numerical tolerances without
  changing the non-majority classification at $s=0.05$
- **Falsifier:** no adjacent pair in the frozen refinement ladder satisfies all
  existing lifetime, event-fraction, population, product, centroid, and
  classification criteria before the compute ceiling is reached
- **Publish the other outcome?** Yes — failure to obtain a stable endpoint would
  show that this stochastic trajectory test is not yet suitable for adjudicating
  the optical-coherence boundary on the present implementation.
- **Status:** observation — requires a fresh protocol; the fixed extension in
  PR #54 is exhausted and cannot be continued

## How wide is the spread CEPB hides inside its C=C correlation increment?
- **Observed:** Witkowski et al. fit 33 bond-type correlation-energy increments
  to CCSD(T)/CBS correlation energies of 84 molecules ("Correlation Energy Per
  Bond") and claim each increment applies "regardless of the bond length, bond
  angle, sp-hybridization, π-electron conjugation, ionicity, noncovalent
  interactions, etc." The fitted [C=C] increment is −0.205239 Eh. Their
  22-reaction test contains only two hydrogenations and no alkene family, the
  per-molecule residual of the C=C increment within a same-bond-order family is
  never reported, and they concede that CEPB isomerization energies "collapse
  to the HF reaction energies" for positional isomers without quantifying the
  resulting error.

  **129** (2025) 8877–8890, doi:10.1021/acs.jpca.5c04423 — CC BY, SI commits
  the training correlation energies, fitted parameters, and a bond-counting
  script
- **Type:** quantification / falsification
- **Contribution (candidate):** the distribution of the effective C=C
  correlation increment across the C2–C4 alkene/diene family (ethylene,
  propene, 1-butene, cis/trans-2-butene, isobutene, 1,3-butadiene), and the
  CCSD(T)−HF correlation contribution to the positional isomerizations CEPB
  sets to exactly zero — which is not in Witkowski et al.
- **Falsifier:** the extracted per-C=C increments agree within ~1 kcal/mol
  across the family AND the correlation contribution to
  1-butene ↔ 2-butene/isobutene isomerization stays below the paper's stated
  accuracy budget — conjugation-independence then survives the stress test.
- **Publish the other outcome?** Yes — a measured within-family spread the
  paper never reports strengthens their claim if small, bounds it if not.
- **Feasibility:** high. DF-CCSD(T)(fc)/cc-pVTZ single points in Psi4 1.9.1 on
  ≤4 heavy atoms (8 cores / 16 GB); TZ→QZ CBS check on the C2/C3 members only.
  A day of wall time.
- **Relation:** this is the live source the next entry's gate was waiting for;
  the acetylene/ethylene/ethane correlation post is the prior work.
- **Status:** published —
  `/posts/2026-08-03-does-one-cc-increment-fit-every-alkene.html`. Both
  registered verdicts came out **inconclusive** under the frozen rules: the
  Arm A contrast spread is 0.51 kcal/mol at CBS but 1.78/2.45 at
  aug-cc-pVQZ/aug-cc-pVTZ (levels disagree about the 1 kcal/mol bar), and in
  Arm B the smallest pair (cis-2-butene − 1-butene) changed sign between
  cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ. Robust across everything run: all three published
  C=C→C–C+2C–H contrasts miss the CEPB prediction the same way, −3.66 to
  −4.17 kcal/mol at CBS (a systematic swap mispricing, not environment
  dependence), and isobutene is the most correlated C₄H₈ isomer at both
  bases, −1.36/−1.33 kcal/mol vs trans-2-butene against a predicted zero.
  Post-hoc diagnostic: the committed 1-butene structure is a torsional
  saddle (planar anti start, symmetry-trapped optimizer) — a candidate
  our-side cause for the sign flip. Next step below.

## Does repricing the C=C → C–C + 2 C–H swap reduce CEPB's reaction errors?
- **Observed:** Next step from the post above. The three published contrasts
  realizing the C=C → C–C + 2 C–H swap agree with each other to 0.51 kcal/mol
  at CBS while all sitting −3.66 to −4.17 kcal/mol below the increment-predicted
  price — the swap has a consistent price and CEPB charges the wrong one. The
  source's own 22-reaction test set publishes reaction energies whose errors
  a repriced swap would move directly.
- **Source:** own next step; Witkowski et al., *J. Phys. Chem. A* **129**
  (2025) 8877–8890, doi:10.1021/acs.jpca.5c04423
- **Type:** unplotted line
- **Contribution (candidate):** the change in CEPB's published reaction-set
  errors when the contrast-derived CBS price of the C=C → C–C + 2 C–H swap
  replaces the fitted-increment price, and the cost of that repricing to
  total-energy accuracy — arithmetic on the source's published tables, no new
  quantum chemistry
- **Falsifier:** the repricing degrades the swap-containing reaction errors,
  or buys reaction accuracy only at a total-energy cost larger than the gain —
  the whole-molecule fit is then already the right compromise and the offset
  is irreducible within the model form
- **Publish the other outcome?** Yes — either a one-parameter fix to published
  reaction errors or a demonstration that the model form cannot price both
  totals and reactions is worth reporting.
- **Feasibility:** high. Pure arithmetic on the frozen `inputs.json`
  transcription plus the source's reaction table; an afternoon.
- **Status:** observation — needs the reaction-table transcription frozen
  before design.

## Is the correlation contribution transferable within one C–C bond-order class?
- **Observed:** The acetylene→ethylene and ethylene→ethane rungs gave
  opposite-signed reaction-level correlation contributions and did not share a
  per-π-bond increment within chemical accuracy. Their starting bond orders
  differ, so that comparison leaves bond order entangled with the rest of each
  reaction-level correlation balance.
- **Source:** `/posts/2026-07-23-is-hydrogenation-correlation-transferable.md`
  (own next step; draft)
- **Type:** untested regime / quantification
- **Contribution (candidate):** a same-bond-order transferability test across a
  frozen family of isolated C–C double-bond hydrogenations, separating the
  cross-bond-order comparison from within-class variation
- **Hypothesis:** the CCSD(T)−HF contribution per hydrogenated C–C π bond is
  transferable within chemical accuracy across the frozen alkene family
- **Falsifier:** after basis/geometry sensitivity checks, at least one pair of
  predeclared alkene hydrogenations differs by more than 1 kcal/mol in its
  reaction-level correlation contribution
- **Publish the other outcome?** Yes — either a bounded transferable increment
  or its within-class failure would answer the question.
- **Gate before design:** identify a 2025–2026 primary source that makes the
  transferability question live, then freeze the molecular series, conformers,
  basis-convergence check, and pairwise decision rule before running it.
- **Gate status (2026-08-03):** the source requirement is satisfied twice over.
  Witkowski et al. (*J. Phys. Chem. A* **129** (2025) 8877–8890,
  doi:10.1021/acs.jpca.5c04423) fit bond-type correlation increments asserted
  independent of conjugation and geometry; Vincent & Popelier (*Struct. Chem.*
  2026, doi:10.1007/s11224-026-02730-8) report 2–7% fragment-level CCSD(T)
  correlation spreads and declare "green-light" transferability without ever
  propagating those spreads to reaction energies. The design-freeze half of the
  gate (series, conformers, basis check, decision rule) still applies before
  running.
- **Status:** partially addressed by the CEPB post
  (`/posts/2026-08-03-does-one-cc-increment-fit-every-alkene.html`), whose
  Arm A measured the same-swap spread on the source's own published data —
  0.51 kcal/mol at CBS, above 1 kcal/mol at the finite bases, verdict
  inconclusive across levels. A dedicated frozen alkene-hydrogenation family
  at one consistent computed level remains undesigned and unrun.

## Does thermal correction reorder the four sulfamethoxazole conformers?
- **Observed:** Blackmon and Closser optimise sulfamethoxazole to four unique
  PCM minima (A–D) spanning 0.202 kJ/mol, with A the global minimum by
  0.137 kJ/mol over B. Their Table 1 Boltzmann populations — 26.3 / 24.9 /
  24.7 / 24.2 % — reproduce to within 0.05 percentage points from a Boltzmann
  factor over the **electronic** energies alone (we compute 26.26 / 24.85 /
  24.67 / 24.21 %), and the table's own footnote states that zero-point and
  thermal corrections are excluded. The A–B gap is kT/18 at 298.15 K, or
  0.033 kcal/mol against a 1 kcal/mol chemical-accuracy bar. The paper reports
  that frequency calculations were run to confirm all four structures are
  minima, so harmonic frequencies existed at the time; we could not find a
  ZPE- or Gibbs-corrected ordering in either the paper or its supplement.
- **Why this is live:** the paper's structural contribution is that its global
  minimum differs from the geometry several earlier computational studies of
  SMX used, and that identification rests on a separation well below the
  0.5–2 kJ/mol range in which conformer zero-point energies routinely differ.
- **Source:** Blackmon, H.; Closser, K. D. *Determination of ground-state
  structure and electronic excitations of sulfamethoxazole using density
  functional theory.* Comput. Theor. Chem. 2026, 1264, 115931.
  doi:10.1016/j.comptc.2026.115931 — CC BY-NC-ND; the supplement supplies all
  eight optimised ground-state geometries with energies, from which the
  published relative energies reproduce to ±0.002 kJ/mol
- **Type:** unplotted line
- **Contribution (candidate):** the zero-point- and Gibbs-corrected ordering and
  thermal populations of the four SMX minima, which is not in Blackmon and
  Closser's paper or supplement
- **Hypothesis:** including zero-point energy and thermal free energy changes
  which of A–D is lowest
- **Falsifier:** after the corrections A remains lowest and the four populations
  stay within a few percentage points of the published electronic-only values,
  making the published ordering robust to the correction
- **Publish the other outcome?** Yes — "the ordering survives thermal
  correction" bounds how much the near-degeneracy matters, and is directly
  useful to anyone picking a single SMX conformer for excited-state work.
- **Gate before design:** freeze the level of theory, the geometries, the
  thermodynamic quantities, the temperature, the treatment of the primed
  duplicate structures, and the decision rule before running anything. Absolute
  energies will not reproduce on our setup — a gas-phase B3LYP/def2-TZVP single
  point on structure A differs from supplement Table S1 by 1.8 mEh, and the PCM
  discretisation and integration grid are not fully specified — so the design
  must rest on relative quantities computed on one consistent surface.
- **Status:** published —
  `/posts/2026-08-03-does-the-near-uniform-smx-ensemble-survive-thermal-correction.html`
  (experiment run 2026-07-25 under a frozen preregistration, merged
  2026-08-03). The frozen preregistration restated this entry's question as a
  robustness hypothesis — no population moves more than 10 pp and the
  effective conformer count stays at or above 3.5 — and that registered
  hypothesis is what the verdict below names; the entry's original
  reordering hypothesis also did not hold, since A stays lowest in both
  arms. Registered hypothesis **falsified**
  in both arms: the composite GFN2-xTB/ALPB correction moves A from 26.3% to
  45.9% (pure RRHO) / 39.0% (mRRHO-50), max shift 19.7 / 12.7 pp against a
  10.0 pp ceiling, effective conformer count 4.00 → 3.00 / 3.57. All
  method-fidelity gates passed. A stays lowest in both arms, so the source's
  structural claim is strengthened rather than disturbed. Side finding: the
  supplement's eight relaxation-energy magnitudes reproduce to 0.005 kJ/mol
  but their signs oppose the table footnote's stated formula. Next step below.

## Does the SMX ensemble concentrate under a same-level thermal correction?
- **Observed:** Next step from the post above. The falsification used a
  composite free energy — source hybrid-DFT/PCM electronic energies plus a
  GFN2-xTB/ALPB thermochemical correction — which mixes two surfaces by
  construction. Whether the concentration onto conformer A survives when the
  correction and the electronic energies come from one surface is untested,
  and the source's own same-level frequencies exist (the paper states they
  were computed to confirm the minima) but were never published.
- **Source:** own next step; Blackmon & Closser, *Comput. Theor. Chem.* **1264**
  (2026) 115931
- **Type:** untested regime
- **Contribution (candidate):** hybrid-DFT harmonic frequencies with implicit
  water on the four published SMX geometries, and the resulting single-surface
  populations — testing whether the composite result's concentration is a
  property of the thermochemistry or of the surface mixing
- **Falsifier:** the single-surface correction leaves all four populations
  within a few percentage points of the electronic-only baseline → the
  concentration was an artifact of mixing two levels, not a thermal effect
- **Publish the other outcome?** Yes — either result bounds how much the
  published near-degeneracy survives correction.
- **Feasibility:** medium. Four frequency calculations on a 20-heavy-atom
  molecule with implicit solvent; hours per structure on 8 cores, and the
  functional/basis/grid choices must be frozen before running.
- **Status:** ready

## From blinking to absorption: how does one molecule become a spectrum?
- **Observed:** A single fluorescent molecule under a microscope emits photons
  one at a time, with dark intervals and antibunching, while the same molecule in
  a cuvette at micromolar concentration gives a smooth absorption band and steady
  fluorescence. The two experiments are measuring the same electronic states, but
  the connection between the single-molecule Jablonski diagram and the bulk
  spectrum is rarely drawn explicitly.
- **Source:** own teaching; standard undergraduate spectroscopy texts treat
  Beer's-law absorption and single-molecule fluorescence as separate chapters.
- **Type:** composition
- **Contribution (candidate):** a single explanatory route from one molecule's
  quantized absorption/emission events to a bulk absorption spectrum, with the
  nonlinear-optics extension (two-photon absorption) as the same diagram read at
  higher order
- **Falsifier:** the route cannot be made quantitative without introducing
  ensemble averaging, inhomogeneous broadening, or radiative rate constants —
  i.e., the single-molecule and bulk pictures cannot be reconciled by the model
- **Status:** drafting

## What has to be added to a molecular Jablonski diagram to get a bulk nonlinear susceptibility?
- **Observed:** The same transition dipole that gives one-photon absorption also
  gives two-photon absorption, hyperpolarizability, and, in an ordered ensemble,
  second-harmonic generation. A single Jablonski diagram shows states; it does
  not, by itself, show how a macroscopic χ⁽²⁾ or χ⁽³⁾ emerges.
- **Source:** own next step from the single-molecule/bulk spectroscopy thread
- **Type:** composition
- **Contribution (candidate):** a dependency-ordered explanation connecting the
  molecular hyperpolarizability β (from MO symmetry and transition dipoles) to
  the bulk susceptibility χ⁽²⁾, including why phase matching and ensemble
  orientation matter
- **Falsifier:** the molecular hyperpolarizability is not the dominant source of
  bulk nonlinear response for the chosen examples, or the symmetry argument
  cannot be made without invoking crystal-field effects that are outside the
  molecular-orbital picture
- **Status:** ready — shelved; the blinking-to-absorption framing is the lower
  hanging fruit

## Why can a single molecule fluoresce but not generate second-harmonic light, while a bulk crystal can?
- **Observed:** Fluorescence is a one-molecule process; second-harmonic generation
  vanishes in centrosymmetric media and requires a non-centrosymmetric ensemble.
  The two processes are often taught separately, but the contrast is sharp:
  fluorescence survives inversion symmetry, SHG does not.
- **Source:** own next step from the single-molecule/bulk spectroscopy thread;
  relates to the selection-rules post and the Pockels-effect post
- **Type:** composition
- **Contribution (candidate):** a clear symmetry-level explanation of why
  fluorescence is an incoherent single-molecule emission while SHG is a coherent
  ensemble process, with the centrosymmetric cancellation as the central move
- **Falsifier:** the explanation cannot account for SHG from individual
  non-centrosymmetric molecules or nanostructures, showing the symmetry argument
  is incomplete at the single-particle level
- **Status:** ready — shelved; the blinking-to-absorption framing is the lower
  hanging fruit

## How many electronic transitions sit under DCDHF-Me2's visible band?
- **Observed:** The blinking-to-absorption note (2026-08-12) models a dye as two
  electronic levels and names what that hides — higher excited states,
  excited-state absorption. DCDHF-Me2, the push-pull dye this site computed on
  in 2025, is the natural molecule to count states for: TD-DFT gives the
  singlet manifold, oscillator strengths, and gaps on the same footing.
- **Source:** own next step from the blinking-to-absorption note; the 2025
  DCDHF tooling posts supply the starting structure.
- **Type:** composition
- **Contribution (candidate):** a computed excited-state manifold for a real
  single-molecule dye, read explicitly against the two-level idealization the
  previous note used.
- **Falsifier:** the manifold turns out empty near S1 — the two-level picture
  needs no correction for this dye within the computed window — which is
  itself the reportable outcome.
- **Status:** published — [One dye, one transition](/posts/2026-08-13-dcdhf-me2-transitions.html)
  (PR #76); the planned "several states under the band" thesis was not
  supported, and the note ships the inversion.

## Is the green of the DCDHF fluoro precursor's crystals intrinsic to the isolated molecule?
- **Observed:** Bench observation: crystals of the fluoro precursor to the
  DCDHF amine dyes (F in place of the NMe2 donor; SNAr with amines gives the
  dyes) were green. Green by transmission means absorbing roughly 620–700 nm.
  Whether the isolated F molecule can absorb there at all is untested by us,
  and we could not name a published spectrum for it from memory.
- **Source:** standing — own bench observation from DCDHF synthesis; Lu et al.
  chemistry for the skeleton.
- **Type:** quantification / negative result
- **Contribution (candidate):** a same-footing TD-DFT manifold for the ~32-atom
  F analog (the `dcdhf-me2-transitions` harness reads any xyz; its topology
  check is DCDHF-Me2-specific and needs generalizing), testing whether any
  strong (f ≳ 0.1) transition sits in the red for the isolated molecule.
- **Predictions, to freeze in PREREGISTRATION.md before the run (consensus
  after discussion, 2026-08-12):** (1) the lowest transition's dipole and
  oscillator strength drop substantially without the amine donor; (2) versus
  DCDHF-Me2 the gap widens — the TCF-localized LUMO barely feels the para
  substituent while losing the amine conjugation lowers the HOMO. The F-vs-H
  sign question that was registered here is generic donor-axis physics and
  does not need the TCF acceptor — it has moved to its own entry (the
  benzylidenemalononitrile series, below), which answers it on an ~18-atom
  scaffold. This entry keeps only what requires the real precursor: whether
  the specific DCDHF-F molecule has any strong red absorption.
- **Falsifier (for "intrinsic"):** no strong transition below ~2.0 eV for the
  isolated molecule rules out the intrinsic-molecular explanation; impurity,
  crystal packing/aggregation, and metallic reflection sheen of a strongly
  absorbing solid all remain, and an isolated-molecule calculation cannot
  separate those.
- **Status:** ready — smaller than DCDHF-Me2 (~32 atoms), same pipeline; run
  after `dcdhf-me2-transitions` closes out.

## Is para-fluorine a net donor or a net acceptor in a minimal push-pull dye?
- **Observed:** Discussing the DCDHF fluoro precursor we registered an open
  call: at the para position of a donor-π-acceptor dye, F's −I withdrawal and
  its weak +R π-donation into the CT state pull the transition energy in
  opposite directions, and the net sign is unknown to us. The question is
  generic — it needs a π-acceptor, not specifically TCF (PJ proposal: use the
  TCF precursor chemistry instead; malononitrile's Knoevenagel condensation
  with benzaldehydes gives the minimal dicyanovinyl scaffold).
- **Source:** own registered open call from the fluoro-precursor entry.
- **Type:** quantification
- **Contribution (candidate):** a three-point TD-DFT donor series on
  para-X-benzylidenemalononitrile, Ar–CH=C(CN)₂, X = H, F, NMe2 — 18, 18,
  and 26 atoms (~410–540 def2-TZVP functions), each leg minutes on the
  current box. Three points give the trend a shape: a genuine −I-vs-+R
  competition shows up as a non-monotonic shift or oscillator strength along
  the donor axis rather than as one ambiguous two-point step. The NMe2
  compound is a known molecular-rotor chromophore, so literature spectra
  exist as sanity anchors; the series settles our registered call on our own
  footing rather than claiming an unexplored system.
- **Falsifier:** the F compound's S1 lands red of the H parent (F net donor)
  or blue of it (F net acceptor) — either outcome resolves the registered
  call; a non-monotonic trend against donor strength anywhere in the series
  is the more interesting result. Freeze the predictions in
  PREREGISTRATION.md before the canonical runs.
- **Status:** published — [/posts/2026-08-16-how-the-donor-closes-the-gap.html](/posts/2026-08-16-how-the-donor-closes-the-gap.html)

## How does acceptor strength move the frontier orbitals in a para-methoxy push-pull dye?
- **Observed:** With the donor fixed as para-methoxy, replacing the acceptor with progressively stronger fragments (CN < DCV < TCF) lowers the LUMO and closes the HOMO-LUMO gap. The HOMO, localized on the unchanged donor, moves much less than the LUMO. The π-path is not held fixed — CN is a ring nitrile, DCV inserts a vinylidene spacer, TCF is a dihydrofuran — so acceptor strength and conjugation length move together.
- **Source:** companion to the BMN donor-strength note, not its complementary experiment; that series held Ar–CH=C(CN)₂ fixed and varied X. Replaces NMe₂ with OMe on the DCDHF scaffold for the strongest rung.
- **Type:** understanding
- **Contribution:** a three-point demonstration that the LUMO moves more than the HOMO as the acceptor strengthens from CN to DCV to TCF, shown under two functionals so the functional-dependent absolute gap does not obscure the trend. The confound with conjugation length is named.
- **Status:** published — [/posts/2026-08-16-how-the-acceptor-closes-the-gap.html](/posts/2026-08-16-how-the-acceptor-closes-the-gap.html)

## Does the CF3/phenyl TCF acceptor red-shift DCDHF the way acceptor strength predicts?
- **Observed:** The stronger TCF acceptor replaces the gem-dimethyls with CF3
  and phenyl: net +3 F, +5 C, +2 H → 46 atoms, roughly 1070 def2-TZVP basis
  functions against DCDHF-Me2's 809 (~+30%). Feasible on the current box with
  care; slower and nearer the memory ceiling.
- **Source:** own next step from `dcdhf-me2-transitions` (PJ suggestion);
  natural territory for the hyperpolarizability thread.
- **Type:** untested regime (for our pipeline)
- **Contribution (candidate):** a same-footing acceptor-strength comparison
  against the Me2 baseline: gap, oscillator strength, CT character. Expected:
  red shift with retained oscillator strength — the classic acceptor lever.
- **Falsifier:** the computed S1 fails to red-shift versus DCDHF-Me2 under the
  stronger acceptor.
- **Status:** shelved — queue after the fluoro-precursor question.

## Does Hillel's 2024 push-pull sentence hold for 4-dimethylamino-4′-nitroazobenzene?
- **Observed:** Hillel, Rough, Barrett, Pietro, and Mermut (2024) found that
  protonation of AzPy removes the S0/T1 crossing along CNNC and wrote that
  this "would likely" hold for the wider class of push-pull azobenzenes. The
  same group (2026) later found no S0/T1 crossing on a different push-pull
  scaffold (HPAS) after SF-TDDFT failed and CASSCF/QD-NEVPT2 was used. Neither
  paper scans 4-dimethylamino-4′-nitroazobenzene at RKS/UKS
  B3LYP-D3(BJ)/cc-pVDZ. The private-lab scan of that dye (M4) plus
  azobenzene/AzPy/AzPyH+/2-AzPy controls is the observation this note writes
  up: M4 crosses at 110.5° between both-converged 120° and 105°; M2 does not
  cross at those angles.

## Does Hillel M4 still show an S0/T1 crossing near 110° under Hillel 2024 SF-TDDFT?
- **Observed:** The 2026-08-22 RKS/UKS B3LYP-D3(BJ)/cc-pVDZ note found
  a both-converged M4 S0/T1 sign change whose interpolant is 110.5°,
  between 120° and 105°. That note did not run SF-TDDFT. The 2024
  Hillel method (SF-TDA BH&HLYP-D3(BJ)/def2-QZVPP) on this dye is the
  observation this note writes up: the required window
  (135°, 120°, 105°, 90°) is both-converged and both-assigned; the
  separately relaxed SF-S0 and SF-T1 profile gap ΔE changes sign
  between 90° and 105°. That sign change is not an electronic gap at
  one molecular geometry and is not an MECP.

- **Hypothesis:** M4 still shows a both-converged S0/T1 crossing near
  110° when S0 and T1 are taken from the SF-TDDFT manifold.

  of that profile gap is 98.89°. Next step:
  Does the M4 SF profile-gap sign change survive a same-geometry
  two-root evaluation?

## Does the M4 SF profile-gap sign change survive a same-geometry two-root evaluation?
- **Observed:** Next step from the 2026-08-27 note. The reported
  90°/105° sign change and 98.89° interpolant are a separately
  relaxed profile gap, not two SF roots on one geometry.

  Registered hypothesis **supported**: on both constrained-CNNC
  geometry families, the same-geometry SF-TDA gap E(T1)−E(S0)
  changes sign between 90° and 105°. Linear interpolants of those
  15° pairs sit inside 90–135°; they are not MECPs and are not

  same-geometry SF-TDA bracket with new constrained S0 and T1
  optimizations at intermediate CNNC angles.

## Does a denser 90–105° same-geometry SF-TDA bracket keep the M4 sign change?
- **Observed:** Next step from the 2026-08-28 note. Both geometry
  families change same-geometry ΔE sign between 90° and 105°, but
  the stored zeros are linear estimates from a coarse 15° bracket.

## Does an MECP search on the same SF surfaces sit near the denser-bracket interpolants?
- **Observed:** Next step from the 2026-09-09 denser-bracket note.
  Both geometry families keep a same-geometry ΔE sign change on the
  100–105° pair; the stored zeros are linear interpolants of that
  pair.

## Does carboxylate oxygen charge oscillate with CX3 rotation, with larger amplitude for CCl3COO− than for CF3COO−?
- **Observed:** Johnson, Gregory, Robertson, Gresham, Nelson, Craig, Prescott,
  Page, Webber, and Wanless (2025) reported DDEC6/MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ charges in
  which CCl3 withdraws more from carboxylate oxygens than CF3, proposed
  carboxylate π → σ*(C–X) hyperconjugation, cited ESI Table S2 bond-length
  signs, and invited geometry/bond rotation studies. A private-lab rematch
  plus relaxed φ = X–Cα–C–O scan at B3LYP-D3(BJ)/aug-cc-pVDZ with MBIS
  charges is the observation this note writes up: the CCl3 q(O) amplitude
  is not larger than the CF3 q(O) amplitude.

  CCl3COO− at B3LYP-D3(BJ)/aug-cc-pVDZ, which is not in Johnson 2025,
  falsifies our registered hypothesis that MBIS carboxylate oxygen
  charge oscillates with a larger amplitude for CCl3 than for CF3
- **Falsifier:** q(O) is flat vs dihedral on both haloacetates, or CF3
  amplitude ≥ CCl3 amplitude

## Does the Johnson CX3 oxygen-charge swing appear at DDEC6/MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ?
- **Observed:** Next step from the Johnson-haloacetate note. The registered
  q(O)-amplitude hypothesis was falsified at B3LYP-D3(BJ)/aug-cc-pVDZ /
  MBIS. The 2025 source used DDEC6 on MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ minima and invited
  the rotation; that pairing has not been run.

  MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ, or with Hirshfeld in a Psi4 build that has it — the
  charge scheme and wavefunction the source actually used
- **Falsifier:** CCl3 q(O) amplitude remains ≤ CF3 q(O) amplitude on that
  grid → the miss is not an MBIS/B3LYP/double-ζ accident

## Cyclobutanone S3 doorway at 200 nm (Brady & Crespo-Otero 2025)
- **Observed:** Brady and Crespo-Otero report that including S3 is
  essential for cyclobutanone 200 nm dynamics; an S3/S2 conical
  intersection traps Rydberg 3s, and omitting S3 forces artificial

- **Type:** untested regime
- **Contribution (candidate):** an independent Franck–Condon geodesic
  to an S3/S2 CI and onward S2/S1 characterization at LR-TDDFT or
  SF-TDDFT with aug-cc-pVDZ on our ORCA/Psi4 setup, which is not in
  Brady & Crespo-Otero 2025
- **Falsifier:** under that method the S0–S3 gap does not support
  200 nm population of S3, or the S3/S2 intersection is not
  classically reachable from the FC point
- **Status:** observation — parked after the denser M4 90–105°
  same-geometry SF-TDA bracket. Full DC-FSSH is a compute-limit, not
  this entry.

## D2+ from D2O+ needs asymmetric stretch (Cheng et al. 2026)
- **Observed:** Cheng et al. report that D2+ formation from D2O+
  requires asymmetric stretch to open Ã/B̃ CI hopping, then branches
  into direct, roaming, and delayed channels with reported rises near
  34 fs and 72 fs.
- **Source:** Cheng et al., arXiv:2608.23292,
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.23292
- **Type:** untested regime
- **Contribution (candidate):** a CASSCF/FSSH rematch on D2O+ from
  the Ã surface testing the three-mode O–DD rise times and the
  asymmetry requirement, which is not in that preprint
- **Falsifier:** hops persist without the asymmetric-stretch mode, or
  the three-mode rise times do not separate into the reported
  direct/roaming/delayed pattern under our implementation
- **Status:** observation — blocked on a CASSCF/FSSH stack (OpenMolcas
  or Psi4) on the M1; not an ORCA TDDFT job

## FSSH rates on gapped JT surfaces with C=1/2 vs C=0 (Ghosh, Banker & Engel 2026)
- **Observed:** Ghosh, Banker, and Engel report that the same gapped
  Jahn–Teller eigensurfaces with Berry phase C=1/2 versus a trivial
  C=0 construction give direction-dependent FSSH rates, about 30
  times along $\hat{Q}_y$.
- **Source:** Ghosh, Banker & Engel, arXiv:2608.24864,
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.24864
- **Type:** untested regime / quantification
- **Contribution (candidate):** an independent numpy FSSH integration
  on the published H_top versus H_triv models (parameters F, K, λ
  from the paper), which is not in that preprint
- **Falsifier:** Table 1 direction-dependent rates do not reproduce
  on our integrator, or the $\hat{Q}_y$ nonadiabatic coupling does
  not vanish on the claimed construction
- **Status:** observation — parked after the denser M4 bracket;
  laptop-scale if picked
